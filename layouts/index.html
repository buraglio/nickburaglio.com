    Random junk that updates infrequently.  <a href="about/">(more)</a>

<p>This site is maintained only for self-aggrandizing historical purposes. It's unlikely I'll add much, and the conversion from a very old WordPress site to this Markdown format was less than perfect. There are probably some missing posts, particularly post-2020, but they're likely not worth reading anyway. There are definitely posts with cut off content because migrating from Wordpress to Markdown is....."complicated".</p>
