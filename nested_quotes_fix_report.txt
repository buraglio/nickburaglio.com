NESTED QUOTES FIX REPORT
========================
Date: 2025-12-15

SECOND BUILD FAILURE IDENTIFIED
--------------------------------
Hugo was still failing on Netlify due to nested double quotes in YAML titles.
File: content/post/2008-01-10-sesame-street-dvd-disclaimer-its-for-adults-only.md

Example of problematic syntax:
  title: "Sesame Street DVD Disclaimer: "It's For Adults Only""
  ❌ Nested double quotes break YAML parsing

FIX APPLIED
-----------
Changed titles with nested quotes to use single outer quotes:
  title: 'Sesame Street DVD Disclaimer: "It''s For Adults Only"'
  ✅ Single quotes allow double quotes inside

Or switched to single quotes entirely:
  title: 'John Carpenter''s "The Thing" —remake with G.I. Joe'
  ✅ Apostrophes escaped with double single quotes

RESULTS
-------
Files scanned: 368
Files with nested quotes fixed: 5
