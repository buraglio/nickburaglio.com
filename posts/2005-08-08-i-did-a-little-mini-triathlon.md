I did a little mini-triathlon on the 6th. It was actually really fun, except for the part where I rode an extra 1.17 miles on the cycling part. I got confused as to where to stop and was in such a zone that I passed it right up. In retrospect I think I should have practiced swimming, which I didn&#8217;t do much at all. I was sucking wind after about 100meters due to the fact that I wasn&#8217;t breathing in a consistent manner. My swimming technique was terrible. I plan on doing it again next year, maybe another one too. Anyway [here are the results][1]. I met my goal of doing it in under an hour, so thats good.
