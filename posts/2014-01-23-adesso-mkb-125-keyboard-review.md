Are you old enough to remember the amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard" target="_blank">IBM model M keyboard</a>s?  I am.  And I loved mine.  I had  several of them as did my roommate from that time.

<p style="text-align: left;">
  <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/800px-ModelM.jpg"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-634" alt="800px-ModelM" src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/800px-ModelM.jpg" width="480" height="202" /></a>I remember in the mid 1990s working for a consulting firm in central IL, and during that employment one of the tasks put to us was to install a network with new PCs.  Since this was a large company we were doing this for, they wanted to write off all of their items being replaced (or so I was told), so we threw the old stuff into a gigantic dumpster.  During that install, we trashed likely more than 100 IBM Mechanical &#8220;clicky&#8221; keyboards.  A few of us were devious enough to stow a few away. Several of us them for close to a decade after.
</p>

Now get in your DeLorean and head to 2013.  I&#8217;ve started a new job and I hear that unmistakable sound of a clicky-clack keyboard from some folks I work with.  It&#8217;s oh-so-familiar and I&#8217;m whisked away to a carefree time of gaming, learning Linux and BSD and drinking crummy beer around a table of nerds with computers.

Then there was an email thread about the keyboards.

I got interested again.

After a bit of googling around I found that there is a very, <a href="http://www.clickykeyboards.com/" target="_blank">very large following for the clickey model M-style keyboards</a>. And there is a lot of detail and difference between key styles.  Not surprising, they&#8217;re great devices and apparent;y far more diverse than I ever knew. So, I set out to find a reasonably priced, modern interface (read:USB) mechanical keyboard.  After much deliberation, I settled on the  <a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href=" http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-123.html" target="_blank">Adesso MKB-125 keyboard</a>.  It seems like a good compromise between function, form and cost and is available for about $60 from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adesso-Compact-Mechanical-Keyboard-MKB-125B/dp/B0038KLIPA" target="_blank">Amazon</a>.

Now, I&#8217;ve been using an Apple &#8220;chicklet&#8221; keyboard for years.  Since they came out, actually, and I can say with confidence that I like it.  The tactile response is nowhere near as good, but after 6+ years, it&#8217;s muscle memory, and I knew the MKB-125 would be different in many ways.

That being said, this review isn&#8217;t really a &#8220;review&#8221; per se, it&#8217;s a detailing of the things that someone that has been using a very different keyboard would experience when switching to this device.  It should be said that I love this keyboard.  I&#8217;m going to buy another one for home to replace my apple keyboard there.  However, it is requiring a re-training of my habits.  Some of the things I experienced that I did not expect (but perhaps should have) are detailed below.

**Lack of special apple keys.  **I did not realize just how much I used the keyboard volume keys as well as the mission control stuff.  There are ways to re-map some of it (although I&#8217;ve not found a way to do the volume yet), mission control stuff is all available via hotkeys.  I&#8217;m still working through this.

**Tiny space bar.**  I didn&#8217;t catch this one.  It&#8217;s still annoying, but I purposely got a compact keyboard.  I should have seen it coming but didn&#8217;t.  My hands are slowly learning that the alt key isn&#8217;t the spacebar.

  <strong>Misplaced ESC key.</strong> This is irritating.  Again, I know I got the compact keyboard, but I never realized just how much muscle memory was there for that esc. key.  <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3894.jpg"><img class="wp-image-630 aligncenter" alt="IMG_3894" src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3894-1024x768.jpg" width="368" height="277" /></a>
</p>

**No support for num-lock on mac**? Have not figured this one out yet.  It doesn&#8217;t claim mac support, so who knows.  I have done zero investigation but I have lamented it a fair amount.

**Lack of USB hub.** Again, this could have been solved by getting the <a href="http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-124.html" target="_blank">MKB-135B</a> for roughly $15 more.  Perhaps I&#8217;ll get that one for home.

**Noise.**  These things are _**loud**_.  If you forget to mute on a conference call or video conference and start typing, everyone will know.  If you have little kids and want to work while they sleep in the next room, that&#8217;s a crap shoot.  They&#8217;re that loud.

All that being said, I love this keyboard.  The mechanical keys are audibly reinforcing and I very much like the tactile response.  It&#8217;s both nostalgic and useful.  It reminds me of being in high school around 1991 and learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC" target="_blank">BASIC</a> on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2" target="_blank">IBM PS/2</a>.

I would highly recommend anyone who spends serious amount of time writing code, prose or any other typing-intensive tasks to seriously consider a mechanical keyboard.  There are <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide" target="_blank">many guides out there</a> to help you decide what is right for you and you&#8217;ll be surprised at how much you like it.
