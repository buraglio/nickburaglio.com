A lot has been going on. I&#8217;ve been to Aruba on vacation and to Canada for a [great conference][1]. Summer is here and I&#8217;m gearing up for the [MS150][2]&#8230;..It looks like we&#8217;re sticking around Champaign for a while longer, but life&#8217;s about to get a little more interesting&#8230;&#8230;..

Thats right, I&#8217;ve gone and procreated.
