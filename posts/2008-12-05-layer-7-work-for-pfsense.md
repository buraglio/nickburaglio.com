I&#8217;m not really sure how I missed [this][1], probably because it&#8217;s some students doing the work, but nevertheless, it&#8217;s very exciting.   
This is something that has been unavailable for the most part under *BSD, but [available for quite some time under Linux][2]. I personally don&#8217;t like iptables and find it much less elegant than pf, both in implementation and practice so seeing this work is very encouraging and I can&#8217;t wait to test it out.   
Adding this into [pfSense][3] is a very exciting thing!

Add [this blog][5] to your RSS reader to keep track! 

BGP, QoS, L7, pf, CARP (and OSPF if I can get off my butt and finish the GUI), [pfSense][3] is going to take over the world!
