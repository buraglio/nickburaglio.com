I&#8217;ve been thinking about moving this blog over to movable type due to the more user friendly and extendable nature of it, even though I don&#8217;t like the idea of a mysql backend (my old MT install just uses sqlite).  With the useful iphone support and ease of use It just seems like the right thing to do&#8230;..and since it&#8217;s already pretty much done, here it is.  Note the cheery default color scheme (6/27/2008, it&#8217;s probably going to change&#8230;..)
