I spied this Subaru (woohoo!) Impreza driving down Neil St. here in Champaign the other day on the way home from work. Google street view making it to the corn field!   
The tech on the inside looked pretty neat. Had they been parked I would have requested a look at it from the seemingly teenage driver (he looked to be about 18 or 19 and appeared to be extremely bored).
