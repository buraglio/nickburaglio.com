The video of [The Wormhole Coffee Shop][1] was sent to my by my younger brother today. This place looks to be so full of awesome; I had to watch this video twice. It&#8217;s like my childhood and my adulthood had a baby and that baby was an amazingly cool coffee shop! What is not to like about [Doc Brown&#8217;s DeLorean Time Machine][2]!?! 

I&#8217;ve never been there, but as soon as I get back up the Chicago area, I&#8217;ll be making a special trip to get some coffee at this place.  Any place that has a coffee [drink named after a Ghostbusters character][3] has to be pretty cool.
