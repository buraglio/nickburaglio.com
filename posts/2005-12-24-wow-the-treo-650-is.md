Wow, the treo 650 is a huge step up from the Treo 600. Better Screen, better camera, MUCH better QWERTY keyboard, etc, etc. I&#8217;ve had mine about 24 hours now and damn, I like it a LOT. I am still waiting on my accessories, Plantronics BT headset and cool rubberized case but even w/o them this thing is very nice. A few things to note if upgrading from the 600:  
The connector is different. You&#8217;ll have to get a new car charger and cradle.  
Bluetooth is crippled on the verizon unit.  [Follow these instructions for unlocking it][1]  
buy some stuff from [Treonauts][2]. This guy provides a nice resource for Treo users.
