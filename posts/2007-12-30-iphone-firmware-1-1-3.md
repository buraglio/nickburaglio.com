With the impending release of the iPhone firmware 1.1.3 there are a lot of additions, most important to me being the inclusion of multi recipient SMS messages (something that should have been there from day one). [cre.ations.net][1] has a video of one of the other cool features, movable icons (something available with a jailbroken iPhone for a long time). Anyway, it&#8217;s nice to see apple actually including it. I&#8217;m still waiting to see the \*actual\* release date, it&#8217;ll probably be around Macworld, but who knows. &#8230;now all they need is MMS to be compliant with phones from 2003. ![][2]
