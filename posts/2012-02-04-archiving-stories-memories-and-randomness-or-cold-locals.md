One of the things about the internet is that it is a good place to put things that you never want to forget. Stories, pictures, music, video, anything. Once it&#8217;s on the &#8216;net, it&#8217;s likely there for good as there is no way to know if it can ever be completely deleted. As I thought about that, and as I near my 37th birthday,  I relaized that there are a lot of things that are word-of-mouth stories about &#8220;adventures&#8221; that myself and my friends had as youngsters growing up a bit different in a rural Central Illinois town.  Make no mistake, we did a lot of really fun, cool stuff back then.  We were fearless, rule breaking, limit pushing little jerks. 

The fact that most of us weren&#8217;t really jocks, nerds or brianiacs made us just a bit different.  We liked things like BMX, skateboarding and punk rock.  We weren&#8217;t the status quo for a small midwestern town.

Of course, some of us where a bit of all of those things, but, speaking for myself, I didn&#8217;t really identify with just one of those cliques and always felt at home, but a bit out of place, too.   
We&#8217;ve told these stories, and talked about our prized possessions from those days over and over.  We&#8217;ve thumbed through the pictures hundreds of times.  Some of these stories are fantastic and even somewhat unbelievable, but I assure you, they&#8217;re all true (some are also probably lame and boring =).   
I decided to take it a step further and write them down, post the photos and invite comments to a new blog called <a href="http://www.coldlocals.com/" target="_blank">Cold Locals</a>, named for the skate &#8216;zine that I tried to make around 1988-1989.   
It&#8217;s possible that I may cross post to here, but I have not totally decided on that aspect yet. 

Check it out if you ever want to know why I am the way I am or you just have a load of time to waste.
