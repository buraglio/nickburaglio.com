I decided it was finally time to brew one of my favorite styles for myself. I jumped in with both feet on this one, what I hope to be a VERY hoppy Pale Ale, which I&#8217;ve so creatively titled &#8220;Buraglio&#8217;s Pale Ale&#8221;.   
The recipe can be found on Google Documents [here][1].  
Here is an image of it fermenting after 2 days. This was my first batch ever that actually needed a blow off tube rather than a simple airlock. 

From the recipe you one can see that I added a lot of not only high IBU hops, but just a lot of hops in general.   
As an aside, I&#8217;ve never used whole hop cones before (thanks to Kat Wefel for the hookup of her [home grown Nugget hops][2]). They&#8217;re a little different to deal with, needing to be strained before the move can be made to the primary fermentation vessel.   
I&#8217;m still undecided regarding the dry hopping. I may wait for version 2 to give that a try or maybe I&#8217;ll get ambitious, only time will tell.
