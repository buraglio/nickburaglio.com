One of the greatesst shows of all times is coming to the bug screen! I&#8217;ve been waiting for this for a LONG time. [Strangers with Candy][1], one of the least PC and smartest shows to come out of Comedy Central is coming to theaters this month. I have a feeling that I&#8217;ll have to wait for it to make it to Champaign, IL but hopefully it&#8217;ll be worth it. I absolutely loved this show, as did many of my friends, but alas, many did not (or don&#8217;t) appreciate it&#8217;s humor much like many of the shows I enjoy[ed].  
Anyway, supposedly the &#8220;new&#8221; show &#8220;It&#8217;s always sunny in Philadelphia&#8221; is just as, if not more crass. I&#8217;ve been looking for the first season and just set up a season pass on my tivo for this season. We&#8217;ll see if it can live up to my expectations.

There is nothing better than comedy that takes no prisoners and pulls no punches.
