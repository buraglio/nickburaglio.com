Well, too many years of skateboarding have taken their toll on my 30 year old body. An old injury from ~10 years ago has once again reared it&#8217;s ugly head. After doing my normal [Saturday morning workout][1] and doing one 5 minute round my back started to tighten up. By the time I had gotten home I could barely get out of the car. So much for training hard for the [mini triathlon][2] that I&#8217;m (hopefully still) doing. Now that I can&#8217;t get off the chair I&#8217;ve been really scouring the net for other little activities I can do. If I can get back to training soon I think I may also try to do the [duathlon in Charleston, IL][3]. Who knows, I hope to feel better in a few days.  
I&#8217;ve also been looking at getting a road bike. Champaign Cycles has some REALLY good deals on both the [Trek 1200][4] and [Trek 1000][5]. They also have a good price on a Lemond that is my size.
