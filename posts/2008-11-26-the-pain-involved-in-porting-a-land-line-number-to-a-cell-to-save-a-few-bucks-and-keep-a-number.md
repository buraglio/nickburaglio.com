Where to actually start on this&#8230;&#8230;.  
Since the availability of [LNP (Local Number Portability)][1] I&#8217;ve contemplated moving our landline number that has been in place for about 10 years to a family share type of line on our cell plan.   
Why, you may ask, would one even bother to keep a land line in this day and age other than [e911 service][2] or a DSL or other data service line that requires it? History. We have had this number for so long that it would be almost more trouble to get rid of it.   
![][3]  
Certain people don&#8217;t like to call cell numbers, certain people have it programmed into their phones, etc, etc, etc. The list goes on and on. A few other reasons that are of note are the fact that some people just don&#8217;t like talking on a cell phone. A &#8220;traditional&#8221; handset is far more ergonomic, doesn&#8217;t get hot in use and can be easily extended to multiple handsets.   
**But wait! VoIP! VoIP!** Yeah&#8230;..read the fine print. I&#8217;ve deployed VoiP before in a small enterprise, I know the things that can \*not\* work with VoIP, and the fact that it&#8217;s not technically classified as phone service by the [FCC][4] can sometimes (but not always) make it painful to get a ported number out of there should you want to move to a new service. I did strongly consider both [Vonage][5] and [Broadvoice][6] but ultimately decided against it after discovering the aforementioned details and, more importantly, Comcast took over my are for my data service and it became &#8220;comcastic&#8221; (translated, less reliable). Cable VoIP is an option in my area as well but the price point isn&#8217;t much better than a traditional [POTS][7] line.   
So we&#8217;re back to a cell line. Why not, I have thousands of rollover minutes and they are just going to waste in their current state.  
At this point I was ready to bite the bullet and try it out. I have existing service with AT&T and am relatively happy with it so I figured, what the heck, now I need to find a way to make it work with a friendlier handset.   
There are many, many options for this at this stage in the game. I looked at pretty much all of them that I could find. I read the reviews, tested a few out and ultimately ended up with the [Dect 6.0 Cellfusion Caller Id 2HS No Jack][8]. The only shortcoming I found is the lack of an answering machine, but the cell voicemail should cover that, or so I thought at the time. As an aside, they do offer a [Cell fusion with an answering machine][9] but the extra money turned me back to the original. Both are [DECT][10] systems which, in theory, means less interference.   
Voicemail was still an issue, since I don&#8217;t want to have to check the actual cell device to see if there is a message waiting for me. A visual or auditory indicator would be optimal. I couldn&#8217;t really figure out an elegant way to do this, so I&#8217;ve opted to try forwarding unanswered calls to [youmail][11], which i thought would update the [WMI][12]on the phone system I bought, but it only seems to be able to update the MWI on the cell&#8230;bummer. Option hack #2 was to still use youmail and have it send an &#8220;email&#8221; to a special &#8220;mailing list&#8221; I create that has my and my wife&#8217;s Email to TXT/SMS addresses as members so we&#8217;d just get a txt message to each of our regular cell phones and check it from there. &#8230;..it&#8217;s a hack, I know. I have a feeling that I&#8217;ll be returning the original phone system and getting the one with the answering machine since there are so many dependencies in my current methodology. 

**To the port.**   
Well this, I thought, would be pretty straight forward. I&#8217;ve ported cell numbers a few times and it&#8217;s always been really painless and respectably quick. No. It&#8217;s not the same as porting a cell number. I needed all of the things you&#8217;d expect, the account number, SS# of the account holder (and the account holder available, since it was in my wife&#8217;s name) as well as (and this is the part that I didn&#8217;t know about), I needed to remove all the services off of the [POTS][7] line. Blech. So many steps. After removing all services off of the POTS line (which, by the way, is amazing to watch since you get SO used to things like caller ID) I called back.   
Port underway. 7-10 business days. A deep sigh. OK, I&#8217;ll wait it out. After 2 days the port was &#8220;approved&#8221; (I found this out by calling the AT&T port center @ 1-188-895-1097), it asked me to enter some information and finish it. Fantastic. I enter the information and it throws some error and drops me to a person. They can&#8217;t find the number and after searching for a few seconds let me know that there is a &#8220;due date&#8221; of 3 days from now at 11pm. No problem, that is still not _that_ long. I&#8217;ll wait it out. 

After a few more days of waiting and 2 more short calls to AT&T (one when they were closed), the number is now ported in. The port was very easy once the approval process was done and the time had elapsed.   
I opted to forward my number to [GrandCentral][13] to start off with, they have more options as far as forwarding and screening calls so I figured I&#8217;d try them first.   
I still have a feeling I may be getting the cell fusion phone system with the answering machine, but the band-aid has been ripped off at this point; the hard part is done. 

Back out plans are in place, if the service is just awful I still have almost 3 weeks to back out, return the cell line and port my number back in, hopefully without a reconnect fee since we would be considered a &#8220;win back&#8221; customer. 

Only time will tell. Let the testing begin.
