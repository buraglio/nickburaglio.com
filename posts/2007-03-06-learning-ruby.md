I am not a programmer, but the idea of creating useful software intrigues me. I&#8217;ve taught myself enough Python to do simple things and I can usually modify and understand most Perl scripting as well as do some stuff in PHP.  
Ruby is something that I always heard was really nice (much like Python), so I decided I was going to try and learn some of it. There are some really useful tools for doing things on your OS X mac with ruby (and Python), things like [RB-Appscript][1], an apple event bridge for Ruby. It allows for applescript functionality within Ruby.  
Anyway, I came across [This Mail.app Speedup &#8220;Hack&#8221;][2] and decided to write a Ruby script to do it for me when called from the CLI. [Here][3] is the result. If you use it, I take no responsibility, I&#8217;m not a programmer.  
Ruby is pretty slick, I think I may actually try and use it and learn it a little better.
