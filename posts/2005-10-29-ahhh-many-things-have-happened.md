Ahhh, many things have happened since my last post. I went to seattle to help with [Scinet][1], Rebecca and I went to Mexico (cabo san lucas) for vacation, and I&#8217;ve been preparing for my return trip to Seattle for  [Supercomputing &#8217;05][2]. The one thing I hate about travel is that it interrupts my training schedule. I especially miss the submission wrestling and jiu jitsu, I even miss the conditioning. I had to miss 2 submission tournaments and have to miss one more. Kinda sucks, I have not done a tournament in a year now and really want to test myself again. Anyway, some exciting stuff is going on, working with the smart guys over at the pfsense project&#8230;&#8230;just wait and see what comes out next. All of you router monkeys are going to like it&#8230;.a lot. I&#8217;m also itching to do another tri or duathlon. I&#8217;m toying with the idea of doing one of the indoor ones in Janurary. Who knows&#8230;.. I&#8217;ll post some pics from my next trip to Seattle (BTW, Seattle is very, very cool).
