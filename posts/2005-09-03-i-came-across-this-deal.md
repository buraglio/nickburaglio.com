I came across this deal at [slickdeals.net][1]. [Yahoo has domain purchases for $1.99 per year][2]. Normally I use [godaddy][3] but this was too good of a deal to pass up. I picked up nickburaglio.com again (I had let it lapse back in like 2000) for a couple of years for under $4.00 and moved the blog over to it. Not too bad of a deal for a self indulgent domain such as this.  
On a less entertaining note, I noticed that all my i386 boxes that I own (which are old to begin with) are pretty much dead except one. It sucks since I&#8217;d really like to have a nice machine to run freebsd on. I wouldn&#8217;t want to run it on one of my macs and miss out on OS X.
