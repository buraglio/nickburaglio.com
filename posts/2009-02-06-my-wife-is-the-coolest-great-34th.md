My wife is super cool. Not only is she a great mom to our [son][1], she&#8217;s smart, hot and actually listens to me when I talk about stuff I **know** she&#8217;s not interested in. Case in point, my birthday. I&#8217;ve always been a fan of watches and timepieces, and shes bought me several watches for my collection over the years.   
This year we are a little busy and I actually forgot about my own birthday until she reminded me. All that aside, I&#8217;d been reading up on watches on my paternity leave from work and really learning about movement types, etc.   
I&#8217;d been rambling (possibly incoherently) on about [automatic watch movements][2] for a few weeks and mentioned how I thought that it was cool that Orient still did their own automatic movement even after Seiko had purchased them.   
Well, low and behold, she got me an [Orient Dive watch][3]&#8230;which I had planned on buying for myself at some point. That is cool enough, but she went above and beyond and got me a sweet zulu band for it from [Panatime][4], probably the best source for getting bands.   
I am truly blessed.
