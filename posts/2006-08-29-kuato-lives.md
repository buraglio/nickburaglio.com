I happen to love t-shirts. I&#8217;d be so bold as to say that I collect them, especially shirts that remind me of growing up. A group of us were talking about [Total Recall][1], Kuato specifically, and I thought it would be cool to have a Kuato Lives shirt. Low and behold, someone else has already done it! [

You can get the shirt from [Cafe Press][2]. I think I may order one.

Quaid, open your mind to him&#8230;.
