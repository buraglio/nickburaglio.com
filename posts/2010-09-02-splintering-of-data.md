I&#8217;ve more or less realized that as I get older, my memory retention is getting worse. I have always had a pretty good memory, but it&#8217;s oddball things that I remember, like quotes from Ghostbusters or my friends phone numbers from grade school.   
I&#8217;ve never been great at taking notes and so, to that end, I&#8217;ve decided to work on doing just that.   
I have taken one of the many oddball domain names that I own, in this case [coprophage.net][1] and started documenting my technical (both work and non-work) related stuff there. I plan to use this site as more of a personal blog and [coprophage.net][1] as my personal tech-diary kinda thing.  I&#8217;ve already put a few posts up there detailing some Juniper SRX firewall/IDP things I&#8217;ve run into and have also added a Cisco AAA post.  Mostly I just want to detail some of the things that are odd, have poor documentation, are hard to find answers to or things that I just want to be able to reference later.  So, if you like geeky, network related cisco, juniper, foundry, and security related text, head on over.  Hopefully it won&#8217;t fizzle out and I can keep it updated.   
Don&#8217;t expect it to be correct all of the time, or even relevant to the current techno-babble-buzzword-of-the-day. It&#8217;s mostly for me, but if you find it useful, thats great too.
