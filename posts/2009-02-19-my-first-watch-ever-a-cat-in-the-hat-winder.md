While rooting through a box in my basement, I came across something that I had no idea I still had. It was my very first watch, a cat-in-the-hat winder. I remember receiving this little treasure as a gift for xmas, probably around 1980. I was really young so memories are a little hazy, but I do remember wearing it proudly to grade school on it&#8217;s black leather band (now lost). I pulled this thing out of that box and it was like a blast from the past. Now that I have a 7 week old son, I find myself thinking about stuff I never, ever thought I&#8217;d spend mental cycles on, what kinds of things will he remember when he is my age? Will he save everything like I apparently did?   
Amazingly enough, this watch still works. It&#8217;s a hand winder with some kind of a swiss movement. On the case back it reads:

**Lafayette Watch Co  
Swiss Made  
Base Metal  
26002**

The &#8220;crystal&#8221; appears to be some kind of hard plastic and it&#8217;s fairly scuffed but it actually keeps decent time. My mother could not believe that I still had it. <figure style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone">

Now, if I could only find a replacement for my first digital watch.

[This][1] is the only reference I have ever seen to one of these. It was probably my all time favorite watch, I remember when it stopped working. I was pretty bummed. Mine was black and I remember receiving it as well. Great memories.
