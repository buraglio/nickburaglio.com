### hofbrau maibock 

I&#8217;d never had (or heard of) a Maibock before I saw this. Billed as &#8220;munich&#8217;s first maibock&#8221;, this was a sweet carmel tasting beer, historically enjoyed in the springtime in germany. A decent punch but I&#8217;m not sure of the alc. content in this $2.99 pint bottle. I&#8217;d not had any food when I enjoyed it and was left with a little buzz. A dark carmel color with very little head, it was a good drink. I&#8217;d recommend trying one if presented with the opportunity.
