Finally, finally, finally. The iPhone 3.0 OS that was [announced this week][1] is **finally** adding features that the original iPhone should have had. Features that some of which, other than a software addition, were always possible, not new, but nonetheless unavailable.   
The features include:  
Exchange 2007 remote search support  
[MMS][2]  
Copy/Paste   
Read and compose email and text messages in landscape  
&#8230;among many others.

Some screenshots, linked via [BGR][3]:

We&#8217;ve finally stepped out to 2004 with the addition of [MMS][2]. [MMS][2] is a luxury, I agree, but i used to use the heck out of it and the fact that it wasn&#8217;t available on such an elegant device such as the iPhone was, frankly, stupid. The argument that we should &#8220;email photos&#8221; holds no water since (being very generous) only 20% of people have smartphones that can get email.   
Copy/Paste is also not new, but was something that I could understand not being in the first rev of the iPhone. The touchscreen implementation was completely new and I&#8217;m sure it was hard to get that aspect just right. A little late, but Kudos, apple.   
Exchange 2007 remote search support&#8230;.ehh, I don&#8217;t really care that much but I may care more if I have to switch to exchange for work email. Lets just hope we can have more than one [ActiveSync][6] account since now [google offers a push calendar solution][7] that I&#8217;m pretty much fully invested in. 

[Official apple page][8] on the subject. 

This looks pretty slick. I can&#8217;t wait.
