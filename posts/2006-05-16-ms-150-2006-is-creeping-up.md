I&#8217;m doing the MS150 bike ride again this year. It&#8217;s creeping up and I have not done any training other than short rides since my triathlon in Sullivan on May 6th. Weather has been crummy, and my [new steed][1] has been sitting in the garage begging to go for a decent ride.  
But thats really not what the MS150 is about.  
Along with [Team Remarkable][2] we hope to raise some good money for MS research. Rebecca and I are both riding along with many other family members. We ride for my cousin Mark Buraglio, who was diagnosed with MS in 1995. All donations are tax deductable and they all go to a great cause.

To donate to me just click [here][3].  
To donate to Rebecca click [here][4]

Every donation helps.
