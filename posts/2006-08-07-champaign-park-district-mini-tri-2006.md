I did the &#8220;24th annual&#8221; Champaign Park District mini-triathlon again this year. It&#8217;s a very short sprint triathlon that the Champaign Park District puts on every year, it&#8217;s usually pretty fun, being very short and very close to my house. I had originally planned on training for this at least a little, but alas, I didn&#8217;t. Overall I did ok, placing 83rd overall out of 350 with a final time of 48 minutes and 01 seconds. Not terrible I guess for not having trained anything but cycling since the sullivan triathlon. Total results can be found [here][1].  
The swim was a bit different this year. They had us start in the lazy river, which was, in my opinion, too shallow. I would estimate that 80% of the participants just walked though that part. After that, swimmers had to exit the water, run to the pool and finish in there. It was very odd and I think many didn&#8217;t like it. Personally, I didn&#8217;t care since thats my least favorite part anyway. We&#8217;ll see if they do it that way next year, I suspect that they&#8217;ll get rid of the lazy river leg of the swim.
