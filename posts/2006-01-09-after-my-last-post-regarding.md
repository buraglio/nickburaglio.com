After my last post regarding my treo I started looking into why certain apps were failing or whatever, specifically [rmrdiet][1]. Others were using this app on a treo 650 and it claims support. I reinstalled it to RAM (as opposed to my memory card) and it&#8217;s working very well now. This really is a powerful app for $20 (although I have still not paid). It seems to just give the nag screen and not a requirement for registration. My only gripe is that I can&#8217;t figure out how to add different calorie burning activities. I don&#8217;t use a windows machine so I have not tested the windows app to see if thats needed. Once I figure that out I&#8217;ll happpily give them my $20. If you&#8217;re looking for something that tracks calories, fat, cholesterol, excercise / activities etc, I think I can safely recommend [rmrdiet][1]. I&#8217;m going to try putting it back on my SD card and see if it crashes&#8230;
