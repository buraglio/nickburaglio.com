In the last few weeks I&#8217;ve been in what can only be described as a mission to taste as much good beer as I can.Â  On the short list, all of the stuff at the the [Morgan St. Brewery][1] in STL![morgan st brewery][2]  
(the dark wheat was excellent, as was the altbier). 

I&#8217;ve also been on a Belgian Ale kick, having just bottled mine a few days ago. The [Hoppin&#8217; Frog Belgian Strong ale][3] is a favorite of mine. 

It&#8217;s also [Oktoberfest][4] season, always my favorite time of year. My Oktoberfest was made late so it won&#8217;t really be ready until December but it should be good as well.   
I&#8217;d like to get my 15 Gallon kettle going so I can make some double batches and get my kegs going as well but that will likely come a little later.
