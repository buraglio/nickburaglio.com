I&#8217;m a little frustrated with the WordPress conversion, overall I think it&#8217;s probably better than movable type, but the primary driver for making the changeover was so that I could use the mobile support that came out for the iPhone. Well, I seem to be running into a fairly common bug in it, in that it doesn&#8217;t seem to be able to read my configuration or write to my pages.   
I&#8217;m quite confident that it is either   
a. something I need to tweak, or   
b. something that will be fixed soon if it is in fact a bug.   
I&#8217;ll probably did a little deeper into it tonight to make sure that it isn&#8217;t a problem on my end. 

Either way, I&#8217;m looking forward to being able to shoot photos up here directly from my iPhone&#8230;.  
It should be fun.
