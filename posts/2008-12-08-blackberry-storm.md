A lot of folks have asked me about the [Blackberry Storm][1]. Well, it looks like an impressive device, and if I still had Verizon Wireless and didn&#8217;t already have an iphone 3g, I&#8217;d very likely have one of these.   
Rumors were flying about initial firmware issues, sluggish behavior and general buggyness, but it appears that they&#8217;ve been working on the problems and have fixes either on the way or [already here][2]. [Howard][3] over at [Howard Forums][4] did a decent review, check it out here: 

The only caveat I can think of is that there has always been poor mac support for Blackberries, so if you&#8217;re a Mac user like me, you may want to check the options.
