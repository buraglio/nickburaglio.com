I happen to LOVE [fast times at rigemont high][2]. We had been talking abou t this at work, and I got to laughing at my favorite parts, namely the Jeff Spicoli scene with the bagel. It&#8217;s a well known fact that I love 80&#8217;s movies. Although Fast Times was a little before my time I did grow up watching a lot of movies in the genre on HBO or Beta and even more at the beloved [Clintonia Theater][3].

Since I know there has to be at least a few others that appreciate the humor that I do I thought I&#8217;d post a link to some good [spicoli stuff][5]. The ironic thing is that this page was originally created and hosted at my [current workplace][6].
