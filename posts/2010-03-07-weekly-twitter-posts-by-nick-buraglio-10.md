  * Where did my weekend go?!? Once again I propose that the work week should be 2 days and the weekend 5 days. [#][1] 


  * I&#8217;m hoping that @[ancker010][2] is making some @[weeklyroast][3] #[coffee][4] in the office this morning. [#][5] 


  * When &#8220;they&#8221; say that kids get every sickness that goes around, &#8220;they&#8221; weren&#8217;t kidding. üôÅ [#][6] 


  * Cracked open what I think is the last of the 2008 Oktoberfest homebrew. Thus stuff was really good. #[fb][7] <a href="http://twitpic.com/16ukoj" rel="nofollow">http://twitpic.com/16ukoj</a> [#][8] 


  * <a href="http://twitpic.com/16v74b" rel="nofollow">http://twitpic.com/16v74b</a> &#8211; Just made a quick status page for the OpenOSPFd package for #[pfsense][9]. Wicked. [#][10] 


  * @[chuck_hayes][11] Nice! We may have to head over to Jarlings tomorrow [in reply to chuck_hayes][12] [#][13] 


  * @[decks24][14] just wait until you can&#8217;t sleep past 6:30am unless you&#8217;re hung over. [in reply to decks24][15] [#][16] 


  * Finally got some more @[weeklyroast][3] #[coffee][4] ordered for home. [#][17] 


  * My knees and back feel rickety after that grappling session on the mat. [#][18] 


  * I believe that American pickers is my new favorite show. [#][19]
