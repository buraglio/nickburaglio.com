Since many folks have asked for this recipe, I decided that I should actually go and copy it from my notes to my Google Docs archhive of recipes.

This beer was a bit of a surprise, I made it with some pretty old ingredients a little last minute and didn&#8217;t expect much from it.  I pitched it onto an existing yeast cake from my vanilla porter and just let it go.  It was the 3rd batch I&#8217;d ever done and, boy, it turned out GREAT.  I still think this is the best brew I&#8217;ve ever made.  I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll ever be able to \*truly\* recreate it&#8217;s uniqueness in origin but I will certainly be making another batch of this in the next few months.

A link to the Google Document can be found[here][1], or a local copy can be found [here in my brew archive][2].

This is a good one. If you like a good sweet stout then by all means make a batch of this.
