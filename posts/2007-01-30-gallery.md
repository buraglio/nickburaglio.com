I finally got my photos moved over to a [Gallery Install][1] and stored in a nice postgres database&#8230;. iPhoto is the bomb, there are so many plugins that make it useful. [iphoto2gallery][2] is a marvelous tool. Kudos to the author, it&#8217;s very useful. There are also shutterfly exports, picasaweb export plugins, the list goes on and on. I guess I&#8217;m just spoiled by the fact that I never have to use a windows box.  
I figured I&#8217;d use the fact that Rebecca got me a Canon EOS Rebel XTI for xmas as a driving factor&#8230;(and WOW does it take nice images!), not to mention the fact that we&#8217;ve got a new friend in the house.
