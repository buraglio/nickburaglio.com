New version of iFuntastic will quickly and easily jailbreak iPhone version 1.1.1. You can add your own custom ringtones, too. It does all the old stuff on both old and new iPhone versions. I have a feeling that there will be a firmware upgrade coming pretty close to the Leopard release this week, which will likely break all of this again&#8230;.. Let the madness begin (again).
