I happen to love [It&#8217;s always sunny in Philadelphia][1].   
I find it&#8217;s lack of tact and willingness to push the envelope of good taste refreshing. In fact, one of their recent episodes (who pooped the bed) has a striking similarity to a funny story from my college days when we told everyone that Carl pooped the bed (which he really didn&#8217;t, but damn was it funny).

![Mac doing a roundhouse kick][2]

The strange pop culture references like mac wanting to be a cooler (like from Roadhouse) is downright genius and the physical humor is pretty darned good too. 

![Sweet Dee taking a header into a car door][3]

Everyone should watch this show if for no other reason than to enjoy the references. Charlie is freakin&#8217; hilarious and I want a [Green man costume][4].   
I have an awesome idea for an episode, maybe I&#8217;ll send it in. These guys are probably crazy enough to do it.
