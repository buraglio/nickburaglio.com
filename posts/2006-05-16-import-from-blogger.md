Well, as you can see if you actually read this thing, I got the entire blog imported from blogger. It really was a pretty easy task. There is a lot of documentation on doing it.  
I started with [this][1] but it wasn&#8217;t as helpful as I&#8217;d hoped. I then googled for [this][2] and found pretty much everything I could have imagined regarding the process. Anyone looking to do the same should check out [this article][3]. It tell you stem by step pretty much everything you need to do.  
Everything is now in a nice sql database for easy backups and I have control over the whole process. It&#8217;s also nice that I can publish [images][4] directly from my treo.
