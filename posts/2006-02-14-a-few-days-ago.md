A few days ago I received a package in the mail that I wasn&#8217;t  
expecting. Anticipation was high. What could it be? As I opened it  
up I realized that it was my ipod, back from (dis)repair. I had  
requested one thing only of them. Return it to me in the same  
condition and with the same abilities that it had had for the last 2  
years. HFS+ formatted and able to use the firewire cable that it  
came with. While I realize that they need to cater to the droves of  
clueless windows users, it would be nice to have some one at least a  
\*little\* clued about mac products that they sell in their own  
stores. I am convinced that the ipod I got back originally was not  
completely fixed, I was unable to use it at all with my firewire  
cable, nor were they (on a PC) but it worked fine with a USB cable,  
of which I don&#8217;t have (and don&#8217;t care to use). So I returned it and  
argued with the guy who continuously tried to &#8220;word rumble&#8221; with me.  
OK, fine. Just get the damned thing fixed. I like to go and pick it  
up in the store because I&#8217;m not confident in their repair service.  
Upon getting my device back I want them to demonstrate that it  
actually works (yeah, I&#8217;m that customer). Well, even though I  
requested that at the time of drop off it was sent to my house,  
windows formatted. Needless to say, I was livid. After cooling off  
for a minute I thought that a good test to see if they did their job  
would be to actually use it. So I tried and low and behold it  
actually worked without clicking and grinding (like after the last  
repair) and with my own firewire cable on my own mac. It even let me  
restore it HFS+. I&#8217;m happy with this. The moral of this blurb is  
that even though the &#8220;geek squad&#8221; got me my desired result they  
aren&#8217;t the best source for getting something fixed. I&#8217;d never  
recommend them to anyone.
