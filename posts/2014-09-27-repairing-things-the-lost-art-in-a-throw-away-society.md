Perhaps I&#8217;ll be coming off as a &#8220;walked to school uphill both ways in 10 feet of snow&#8221; old guy, but when I was growing up in the late 70&#8217;s and early 80&#8217;s it seems like we fixed more &#8220;things&#8221;. If your refrigerator had a problem, you called a repair guy. If your TV went on the fritz, you called a repair guy.  If your clothes dryer broke, you had someone come to fix it.  I once disassembled a <a title="If you love something, let it go: Or, The Black Bomber finds a new home." href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2009/04/03/if-you-love-something-let-it-go-or-the-black-bomber-finds-a-new-home/" target="_blank">1973 Honda</a> with nothing more than a <a href="http://chilton.cengage.com/" target="_blank">Chilton</a> book from the public library with moderate success; it&#8217;s not that hard to try and you&#8217;ll always learn something in the process.
  
Having this history, it made me a bit disheartened when some lightning damaged a substantial set of electronics that a relative of mine had and the insurance adjuster just called it all bad and they paid for new. Now, I get it, newer electronics are more complicated and more susceptible to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference" target="_blank">EMI</a>. However, TVs in particular are really just big PCs nowadays. A power board, a motherboard and a giant LCD. That&#8217;s it. Oh, and a case and stand, neither of which is critical to the operation of the device. Knowing that, I took both broken TVs, a 55&#8243; LG, passive 3D smart TV and a 32&#8243; samsung and took them home along with the LG blu-ray player. My logic was that, at the very least, I could have fun showing the kids how to take them apart and we could go over the insides. [<img class="alignright wp-image-674" src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/IMG_4440.jpg" alt="IMG_4440" width="350" height="263" />][1] [

Disassembly was a snap, the hardest part was finding a surface area large enough to set the 55&#8243; face down on.  **Once open it was pretty clear that this would be pretty simple if I could get the parts.  To the right is the inside of the 55&#8243;, it was a tad more complicated but as you can see it is really a quite simple device.  The board on the right is the logic board, essentially a purpose built embedded PC.  The board on the left is the power board.  The power board  on both devices was intact, but the 32&#8243; would not power on.  The 55&#8243; powered on and went into a boot loop.  I suspected damaged flash so I found a used one on ebay for $114.  It was removed from a cracked screen item of the same model.  Incidentally, the LCD is pretty much the only thing that should keep you from repairing a device like this.  It&#8217;s not often cost efficient to replace the screen since it is the bulk of the device cost.

I did the 32&#8243; samsung as a test case since parts for it were $12 each for the board and power supply.  Although I didn&#8217;t see any bulged caps on the power supply capacitors, it would not power on and smelled burned so I replaced it.

10 minutes later and I had a functional 32&#8243; display that is now in my office, powered by a <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/" target="_blank">raspberry pi</a> and displaying <a href="http://my.es.net" target="_blank">network statistics for my job</a> among a few other windows related to my work.  With that working I decided to go ahead and repair the 55&#8243;.

Low and behold, it was simple and quick.  Now I have a 55&#8243; smart TV for $114, complete with <a href="https://plex.tv/" target="_blank">plex</a> support, netflix streaming and a bunch of other apps that I&#8217;ll never use.

The take away here is that stuff isn&#8217;t that hard to fix given the willingness to try.  With the internet the take apart guides are even easier to get and the chances of success are dramatically increased.
