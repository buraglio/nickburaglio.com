Well, I sold and shipped the last of my neo-classic star wars toys today. I&#8217;m a little sad about it but at 31 years old I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be playing with them. With the money I bought a new 2005 [Bianchi Velochi][1] from bikeworks in Urbana, IL. I got a sweet deal on it and it is one hell of a bike. He&#8217;s building it right now and I should have it this week. I rode a few other bikes, a Trek and a Lemond (AL frame bikes) but none were as smooth as the Bianchi&#8217;s I rode. The creamy shifting and light, quick but smooth ride was something I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about as I rode the others. It&#8217;d not a daily rider, mind you. That seat is reserved for my Trek 7300FX, but it&#8217;ll be a sweet training and race bike!
