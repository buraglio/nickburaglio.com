I started trying to make some packages for the [pfsense][1] platform. I&#8217;mnot really a developer and don&#8217;t know xml or php so I&#8217;m using this as an excuse to learn. My first attempt is with pftabled, a very useful c program for free and openbsd for manipulating pf tables remotely. First pass is available [here][2]
