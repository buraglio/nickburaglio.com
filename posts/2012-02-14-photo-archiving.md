It&#8217;s no secret that I&#8217;m a fan of photography.  I&#8217;ve been into it since I was young, doing skateboard photography and eventually ending up with an undergraduate degree in fine art photography.  I was a film hold-out and didn&#8217;t move to a digital format (at least for anything other than point and shoot) until 2006.   
I am also a pretty serious mac user.  I can work on about any platform, but everything I own, save for a linux server in my basement and a D-Link NAS, is apple.   
This can be a blessing and a curse.  I&#8217;m a hoarder.  I never delete anything.  I have huge amounts of disk in my NAS that house primarily backups of things I never want to lose, most of which are home movies and photos.

Being the hoarder than I am, I am not just satisfied with on-site backups, so, I want to document how I back up my photos. 

Let me follow this up by saying that I am \*not\* a professional photographer or videographer.  Yes, I&#8217;ve sold work in the past.    Yes, I&#8217;ve been paid on multiple occasions to rework video and to film and edit together special occasions.  No, I don;t spend gobs and gobs of money on professional class gear for this. I do have some nice lenses for my DSLR.  I do take a lot of pride in the stuff I do. But, I was always taught that expensive, high end equipment doesn&#8217;t make you a good artist, and I still, whole-heartedly, believe that today. 

If you don&#8217;t believe me, read [Ken Rockwell&#8217;s stuff ][1] (thanks [Jim][2]). 

I made photo art with stuff I got at pawn shops.  Hell, I sold art that I made with a polaroid.  You can win awards with cell phone images and take bad images with thousands of dollars worth of equipment.  It&#8217;s about content, composition, juxtaposition, framing, lighting, opportunity and, at it&#8217;s core, having a good eye&#8230;&#8230; 

&#8230;but I digress&#8230;this is about saving data. 

I use iPhoto.  I really like iPhoto.  I like the smart albums.  I like the interface and the plugins.  What I don&#8217;t like, is that
