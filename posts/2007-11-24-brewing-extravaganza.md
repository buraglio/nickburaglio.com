Since I&#8217;ve aggravated a (likely very old) back injury once again and can&#8217;t train or work out nearly as much as I used to until it&#8217;s healed, I have decided to try my hand at making beer&#8230;.and wine (or is it cider?)&#8230;.and mead&#8230;.

I&#8217;ve gone a little overboard.

I&#8217;ve bottled my [first batch][2], an English Brown ale, and after bottle conditioning for about 2 weeks it&#8217;s actually pretty darned good. Nice and clear, not cloudy like I would have expected. I got a little anxious waiting for the beer so I threw together [a spiced orange mead][3] based on the recipe [Ancient Orange Cinnamon & Clove Mead][4].

Cut to 3 weeks later&#8230;.I now have a [Vanilla Porter][5], a batch of [Apfelwein][6] and a 1 Gallon batch of [Cherry Grape Mead][7].

I can&#8217;t wait to try the porter, it should be great. The apfelwein I&#8217;ll likely give away most of unless Rebecca likes it since I don&#8217;t really drink wine or cider (plus I have 5 gallons of it!).

I&#8217;m very excited about the mead. I&#8217;ve really only had mead once and I enjoyed the flavor very much.

I&#8217;ve found some really good resources for brewing, too. [How to brew][9] (site and book) has everything any beginning (or experienced) brewer would ever want to know. The message board [Home Brew Talk][10] also has a wealth of very knowledgeable and friendly folks over there. I&#8217;ve found that site to be indispensable so far.  
It&#8217;s a fun hobby. I find myself spending a lot of time at night reading recipes and techniques then itching to try them out&#8230;
