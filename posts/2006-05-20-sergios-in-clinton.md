We went down to Clinton tonight to see some family and take care of some stuff. We decided to make an evening of it and wanted to head back to Sergio&#8217;s for dinner.  
![][1]  
This place is one of the best kept secrets of my home town of Clinton, IL. Sergio&#8217;s mexican restaraunt has the absolutely undisputed best burritos i&#8217;ve ever had. Their $4.85 burrito is the size of a labamba super and their $9 burrito&#8230;.well it needs it&#8217;s own zip code. I&#8217;d seriously be surprised if it weighed less than 5lbs. Plan on eating it for more than one meal. If you ever get the chance, stop by there. you won&#8217;t regret it. They&#8217;re open 10am to 10pm tues &#8211; sat. ![][2]  
Above is a pic I snapped with my treo, it&#8217;s of the regular ($4.85) chicken burrito. I had a hard time finishing it. I&#8217;ve only seen a $9 on one occasion, it was frighteningly heavy and a huge burrito.
