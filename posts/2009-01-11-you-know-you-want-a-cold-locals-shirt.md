Image manipulation via either [Photoshop][1], [Gimp][2], or whatever is a wonderful tool and can provide hours of entertainment. In keeping with the skateboarding theme of the last few days, I decided to mess a little with some of the images and came up with this:

<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <a href="http://image.spreadshirt.com/image-server/image/composition/4309699/view/1/producttypecolor/1/type/png/width/280/height/280/cold-locals-tee_design.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://image.spreadshirt.com/image-server/image/composition/4309699/view/1/producttypecolor/1/type/png/width/280/height/280/cold-locals-tee_design.png" /></a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td>
      <span>So retro! So old school! Wow, it&#8217;s a xeroxed image!</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Reminiscent of the old do-it-yourself style that was so common in early skateboarding, I just had to have this image from the archives on a some sort of apparel.  
Through the magic and wonder that is the internet, I had nearly instant gratification. A [Short Sleeved T- Shirt][3], a [long sleeved T-Shirt][4], and even the always stylish [hooded sweatshirt][5]. Now you can show your colors if you were a Clinton or Wapella, Illinois skateboarder from the early days.
