A [recent post][1] about integrating our [new son][2] into our family of four legged kids led me to a goldmine that I never knew existed. [Von Welch][3] sent me a funny video from [Cracked.com][4]. I had no idea that they had video, and most of it is pretty darned funny. Anyway, Von sent me [this video][5], which I thoroughly enjoyed.

I have a feeling that this site is going to be a time vortex for me. Thanks Von.
