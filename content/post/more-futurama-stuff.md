I just came across this (I know, it's old).  
  
  
  
I was/am a huge [futurama](http://www.gotfuturama.com/) fan, so news of the dvd movies and possible return with 13 new episodes was very nice. This nice little clip for the movie ["An Inconvenient Truth"](http://www.climatecrisis.net/) was also good (since I happen to subscribe to a great deal of what [the movie](http://www.nickburaglio.com/inconvenient) says).
