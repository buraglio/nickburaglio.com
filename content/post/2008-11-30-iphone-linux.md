[That iPhone Dev team](http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/62041396/linux-here-we-come) has decided to port the linux kernel and [BusyBox](http://www.busybox.net/)to the iPhone and write a completely new boot loader to support dual booting.

[iPhone Linux Demonstration Video](http://vimeo.com/2373142) from [planetbeing](http://vimeo.com/user983560) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/).

I’m not sure that it really means anything for everyday users of the iPhone at this point, but it’s certainly interesting for geeks, hobbyists, code hackers and possibly developers.   
If I had a spare iPhone I might give it a whirl just to see it work, but since I don’t I’ll just be satisfied with the announcement.   
Any way you look at it’s pretty nifty.
