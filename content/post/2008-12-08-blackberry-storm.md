A lot of folks have asked me about the [Blackberry Storm](http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=1864). Well, it looks like an impressive device, and if I still had Verizon Wireless and didn’t already have an iphone 3g, I’d very likely have one of these.   
Rumors were flying about initial firmware issues, sluggish behavior and general buggyness, but it appears that they’ve been working on the problems and have fixes either on the way or [already here](http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/05/verizon-posts-its-first-blackberry-storm-firmware-update/). [Howard](http://www.howardchui.com/) over at [Howard Forums](http://www.howardforums.com/) did a decent review, check it out here:

The only caveat I can think of is that there has always been poor mac support for Blackberries, so if you’re a Mac user like me, you may want to check the options.
