Well, I listed the bulk of my Neo-Classic (1990-2000) Star Wars collection on ebay. It's kinda sad really, I wanted to collect these so bad to I guess try and recapture some of my early childhood. I had actually almost forgotten I had all of thisewhen my parents asked me to take some tubs of stuff out of their basement. I'd been wanting to get a new road bike but didn't want to part with the money so I decided to sell this stuff to cover (I hope) most of a new Bianchi Eros or Veloce. I will certainly be sad to see it go but hopefully it'll go to a kid that will actually play with it and enjoy having his or her own battles and adventures like I did with my early stuff back in the 80's.
