As 2020 marches on in its awful reality, I’ve been plugging away at work and attempting to pacify my anxieties with poorly crafted, esoteric, low-brow art work. Since most of what I draw or otherwise create are things I want to see (never mind that I hate almost all of my own work), and that I think there may be 1-3 other people in the world that may enjoy or at least get a laugh out of it, I have started putting it on RedBubble and TeeSpring. If you’re super bored (which you likely are if you’re reading this) and want to see some of what I have made, it’s almost all available [here](https://buraglio.redbubble.com) or [here](https://teespring.com/stores/cinematic-omelette-studios). Attached are a few examples of the nonsense that I churn out with alarming regularity, like a steady stream of garbage.
