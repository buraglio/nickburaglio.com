I spent some time up in Alaska recently (Fairbanks, to be exact) and I have to say, it was pretty intersting. I taught the ipv6 workshop and participated in a few other talks at[ Joint Techs, Summer 2011](http://events.internet2.edu/2011/jt-uaf/). I didn’t have a ton of time to spend all around the last frontier, but I did get to do a bit of light hiking and exploring on my last day there (before Delta Airlines botched my return flights). 
I think other than the conference (which was really good), the highlights were certainly the food. I had an Elk burger at [The Pump House](http://www.pumphouse.com/), ate myself stupid at the [Alaska Salmon Bake](http://www.akvisit.com/salmon.html), had a few really good brews and a delicious bison burger at [Silver Gulch Brewery](http://www.silvergulch.com/), and hung out until the sun went down (wait, it never sets in Fairbanks in July) at [The Marlin](http://www.myspace.com/marlinfairbanks). ([Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-marlin-fairbanks)). All were totally worth while. While Fairbanks was a little smaller of a college town, it’s a big city in Alaska. If I ever make it back there I’d really like to hit up the [Chena hot springs](http://www.chenahotsprings.com/). If I had it to do over again, I would have taken my nice DSLR camera and made another trip to Silver Gulch (the northernmost brewery in the United States). Oh, I also saw the northernmost Denny’s, which was proudly displayed on a sign.

I grabbed a few pictures with my iPhone and my point and shoot available [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio/sets/72157627095838577/) or in this slide show.
