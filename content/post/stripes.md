[Stripes](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083131/) is a great movie. I bought the extended edition a while ago. While I believe Stripes is a "must own movie", I was sorely dissapointed in the deleted scenes. For some reason I was thinking about Sgt. Hulka today, one quote in particular:  
Soldier, I've noticed you're always last" Winger replies with "I'm pacing myself Sargeant". Genius.
