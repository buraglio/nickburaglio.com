[Clash of the titans](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082186/) was a constant on HBO when I was a kid. The mythology, the adventure, the creatures, and the stop motion animation were captivating to a kid watching them over and over on a console television in a midwestern basement in the early 1980s. While the movie may have been panned by critics, it remains a staple of my “comfort flicks”, reminding me of a fantastic, carefree youth. [Bubo](https://gwangipedia.fandom.com/wiki/Bubo_the_Mechanical_Owl) the owl was a divine, technological marvel to a young viewer such as myself. Here is my crude homage to such a wise old …..robot?

Bubo rules regardless.
