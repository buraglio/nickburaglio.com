It’s been quite a while since I did a beer review and I’ve had SO many unique brews since the last one, but the most recent beverage I had worth writing about was the [Schlafly Imperial Stout](http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/583/33894). I was able to enjoy this the other night thanks to my brother-in-law Rob. I would highly recommend this big brew to anyone that has $ to drop in one big, dark, powerful beer. It’s got some good undertones of bourbon with a little bite, but overall pretty silky. 
I like the Schlafly brewery and, since I’m only about 2 and a half hours from St. Louis, I like to try their stuff and support a \[kinda\] local brewery.

Overall I’d probably give it an A-/B+. I’m not a huge imperial stout fan (and I’m certainly too cheap to buy a bottle myself unless I’d had a few beers first) but overall I really liked this brew.
