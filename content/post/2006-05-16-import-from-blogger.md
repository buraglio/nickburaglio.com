Well, as you can see if you actually read this thing, I got the entire blog imported from blogger. It really was a pretty easy task. There is a lot of documentation on doing it. 
I started with [this](http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/3.2/g_contextsensitive_help/entry_import/start_title_html.html) but it wasn’t as helpful as I’d hoped. I then googled for [this](http://www.google.com/search?q=import+blogger+Movable+Type&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official) and found pretty much everything I could have imagined regarding the process. Anyone looking to do the same should check out [this article](http://weblogs.about.com/od/weblogsoftwareandhosts/a/bloggertoMT.htm). It tell you stem by step pretty much everything you need to do. 
Everything is now in a nice sql database for easy backups and I have control over the whole process. It’s also nice that I can publish [images](http://nickburaglio.com/images) directly from my treo.
