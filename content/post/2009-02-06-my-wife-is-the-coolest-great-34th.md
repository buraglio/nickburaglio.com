My wife is super cool. Not only is she a great mom to our [son](http://www.buraglio.com/luke/), she’s smart, hot and actually listens to me when I talk about stuff I **know** she’s not interested in. Case in point, my birthday. I’ve always been a fan of watches and timepieces, and shes bought me several watches for my collection over the years.   
This year we are a little busy and I actually forgot about my own birthday until she reminded me. All that aside, I’d been reading up on watches on my paternity leave from work and really learning about movement types, etc.   
I’d been rambling (possibly incoherently) on about [automatic watch movements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_watch) for a few weeks and mentioned how I thought that it was cool that Orient still did their own automatic movement even after Seiko had purchased them.   
Well, low and behold, she got me an [Orient Dive watch](http://www.discountwatchstore.com/store-products-Orient-2ER00001B-Orient-Mens-Automatic-Watch-2ER00001B_40014955.html)…which I had planned on buying for myself at some point. That is cool enough, but she went above and beyond and got me a sweet zulu band for it from [Panatime](http://panatime.com/20zubany5pvd.html), probably the best source for getting bands.   
I am truly blessed.
