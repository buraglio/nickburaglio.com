This section of [buraglio.com](http://nickburaglio.com/) is maintained by the domain owner, [me](http://buraglio.com/nick/), [Nick Buraglio](http://buraglio.com/nick/). I've owned buraglio.com (as well as .net, .org and many other domains) since around 1997 and have done my best to do at least something with it. My technical notes and postings (other than maybe some stuff about gadgets) can be found over at [forwardingplane.net](http://www.forwardingplane.net/), my technical blog.
