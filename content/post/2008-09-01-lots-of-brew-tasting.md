In the last few weeks I’ve been in what can only be described as a mission to taste as much good beer as I can. On the short list, all of the stuff at the the [Morgan St. Brewery](http://www.morganstreetbrewery.com/) in STL![morgan st brewery](http://photos-b.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v323/186/92/1954800/n1954800_45122209_7019.jpg) 
(the dark wheat was excellent, as was the altbier).

I’ve also been on a Belgian Ale kick, having just bottled mine a few days ago. The [Hoppin’ Frog Belgian Strong ale](http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/hoppin-frog-gulden-fraug/65880/61657/) is a favorite of mine.

It’s also [Oktoberfest ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest)season, always my favorite time of year. My Oktoberfest was made late so it won’t really be ready until December but it should be good as well. 
I’d like to get my 15 Gallon kettle going so I can make some double batches and get my kegs going as well but that will likely come a little later.
