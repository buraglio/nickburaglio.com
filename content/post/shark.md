Rebecca and I spent the weekend in downtown chicago to "get away" for a bit. It really was quite relaxing, even with my aggrivated back. We got the hookup and got into the [Shed Aquarium](http://www.sheddaquarium.org/) for free, and circumvented the hour-long line. Quite cool. We enjoyed [Shark Week](http://www.discovery.com/sharkweek), something I've done for a long time and were looking forward to seeing the sharks there. We certainly weren't disapointed. I forgot the camera but managed to snap some crappy pics with my treo. They can be found [here](http://www.buraglio.com/pics/vacations/shed-2006)
