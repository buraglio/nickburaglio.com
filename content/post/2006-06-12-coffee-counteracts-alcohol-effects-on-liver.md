Sweet! I love beer. I also love coffee. Hopefully it’s true! [This article](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/13281392/) claims  
“Coffee may counteract alcohol’s poisonous effects on the liver and help prevent cirrhosis, researchers say.”  
The article also claims:  
“The same study found coffee drinkers had healthier results on blood tests used to measure liver function, whether or not they were heavy alcohol users. Coffee’s effect on reducing liver enzymes in the blood was more apparent among the heavy drinkers in the study.”  
I was always afraid I drank too much coffee, even though I drink a ton of water. I won’t worry quite as much now.
