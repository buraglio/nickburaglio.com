I happen to love t-shirts. I'd be so bold as to say that I collect them, especially shirts that remind me of growing up. A group of us were talking about [Total Recall](http://imdb.com/title/tt0100802/), Kuato specifically, and I thought it would be cool to have a Kuato Lives shirt. Low and behold, someone else has already done it!

I think I may order one. Quaid, open your mind to him....
