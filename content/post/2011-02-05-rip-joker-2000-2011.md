Originally uploaded by [buraglio](http://www.flickr.com/people/buraglio/)</span></div>We lost King Joker on 02/03/2011. Probably the coolest cat Iâ€™ve ever encountered, his laid back attitude was a distinct opposite to the other higher strung cats that share the house. It provided a nice balance that will certainly be missed and can never be replaced. Say hi to [Lenny](http://www.nickburaglio.com/2006/12/lenny-buraglio-february-2000-december.html) for me.
