Man, watching the [Lakai Fully Flared](http://www.lakai.com/06/index.php) video atmy friend Sean’s suggeston makes me really miss skating every day. At 33 It’s a little hard on my body after all the abuse but I did get the board out and do a few kickflips and curb tricks for the neighbor kids today. It was worth it but, unfortunately, it made my body really feel the years of abuse. I may kick around at the C-U park a little tomorrow…… 
Hopefully I’ll still be able to walk afterwards……..

I think Jeff Byrd owes me $5 for still skating after I hit 18 Years old.

Watch this and feel in awe…..
