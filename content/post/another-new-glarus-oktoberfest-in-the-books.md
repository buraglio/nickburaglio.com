We didn't get to go last year due to my son Zach being born....this year we were determined to makeit up for the staghorn cask tapping.  Well, we were successful.  It seemed a bit more low key this year, but the food was amazing and the beers were.....better than can be described.  The staghorn cask was wow-factor good.  
  
Here is a little video of the cask tapping I stitched together.
