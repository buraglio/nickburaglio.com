I happen to LOVE [fast times at rigemont high](http://imdb.com/title/tt0083929). We had been talking abou t this at work, and I got to laughing at my favorite parts, namely the Jeff Spicoli scene with the bagel. It’s a well known fact that I love 80’s movies. Although Fast Times was a little before my time I did grow up watching a lot of movies in the genre on HBO or Beta and even more at the beloved [Clintonia Theater](http://cinematreasures.org/theater/11552/).

Since I know there has to be at least a few others that appreciate the humor that I do I thought I’d post a link to some good [spicoli stuff](http://alanb.com/spicoli/). The ironic thing is that this page was originally created and hosted at my [current workplace](http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/).
