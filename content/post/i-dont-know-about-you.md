I don't know about you, but I found this incredibly frightening...

With all the talk of the [CTA machines being vulnerable](http://www.ctatattler.com/2006/02/cta_info_screen.html) and [other MTA](http://img26.exs.cx/img26/5349/dsc019149tz.jpg) machines crashing or being problematic I got to thinking about how many mission critical or sensitive systems are vulnerable, rooted, 0wn3d or whatever. Most Cash machines used to be OS/2 but that's been changing lately and I know for sure some are moving to windows. Lets just hope all these systems are well maintained or more secured than they probably are.....probably wishful thikning..  
  
I'm a paranois by nature. I'm untrusting. I don't like people very much because most of them are stupid (myself included at times). You know, the more I think about it, it's not really the systems that are most at risk. Social engineering is much easier than r00ting a box and most targets are underpaid, unhappy workers that just don't care. How many bank tellers do you know that are well paid? How many personal assistants to powerful execs have access to their email and desktop machines? If you think it's difficult to talk that info out of one of them you are sorely mistaken. Wow, I made myself even more paranoid by that thought alone....Social engineering is often overlooked and ALWAYS a threat.
