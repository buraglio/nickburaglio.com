### Okocim porter 

“Traditional polish taste” it says on the bottle. A dark, thicker, quickly sweet porter. Malty and strong, sharp and quicker flavor than many porters I’ve had. 8.3 percent alc. in this one pint bottle that I picked up at Friar Tuck for $2.99. This was a little different in a way I really couldn’t put my finger on. I’d probably buy this again, but I wouldn’t drink more than one.
