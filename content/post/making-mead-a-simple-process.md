I've been making [mead](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead) as long as I've been making beer, and frankly, mead is much easier. I'm not a big wine drinker or really even a fan of wine, but mead is so easy to make and it turns out well with minimal work so I make it a few times a year. Here is a quick and dirty howto on making simple, traditional mead that I threw together a few nights ago: Mead is a good choice for those wanting to start with [zymology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zymurgy), as it takes few ingredients and can be done on a budget. Mead is simple. Many folks, like in brewing, have a lot to say about checking this and that, boiling the must, etc. I choose to go very basic, start with a base mead and then add fruit later. If you're interested in making mead and want some quick mead recipes or just general information, check out [gotmead.com](http://www.gotmead.com/), they have links and a wealth of information on the subject.
