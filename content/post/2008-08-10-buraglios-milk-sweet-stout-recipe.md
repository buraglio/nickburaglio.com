Since many folks have asked for this recipe, I decided that I should actually go and copy it from my notes to my Google Docs archhive of recipes.

This beer was a bit of a surprise, I made it with some pretty old ingredients a little last minute and didn’t expect much from it. I pitched it onto an existing yeast cake from my vanilla porter and just let it go. It was the 3rd batch I’d ever done and, boy, it turned out GREAT. I still think this is the best brew I’ve ever made. I don’t know if I’ll ever be able to \*truly\* recreate it’s uniqueness in origin but I will certainly be making another batch of this in the next few months.

A link to the Google Document can be found[here](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg6p466h_33fh56k2dv), or a local copy can be found [here in my brew archive](http://buraglio.com/nick/brew/recipes/11_28_2007_Sweet_Milk_S.html).

This is a good one. If you like a good sweet stout then by all means make a batch of this.
