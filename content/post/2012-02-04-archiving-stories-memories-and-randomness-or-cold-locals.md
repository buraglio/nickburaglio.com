One of the things about the internet is that it is a good place to put things that you never want to forget. Stories, pictures, music, video, anything. Once it’s on the ‘net, it’s likely there for good as there is no way to know if it can ever be completely deleted. As I thought about that, and as I near my 37th birthday, I relaized that there are a lot of things that are word-of-mouth stories about “adventures” that myself and my friends had as youngsters growing up a bit different in a rural Central Illinois town. Make no mistake, we did a lot of really fun, cool stuff back then. We were fearless, rule breaking, limit pushing little jerks.

The fact that most of us weren’t really jocks, nerds or brianiacs made us just a bit different. We liked things like BMX, skateboarding and punk rock. We weren’t the status quo for a small midwestern town.

Of course, some of us where a bit of all of those things, but, speaking for myself, I didn’t really identify with just one of those cliques and always felt at home, but a bit out of place, too. 
We’ve told these stories, and talked about our prized possessions from those days over and over. We’ve thumbed through the pictures hundreds of times. Some of these stories are fantastic and even somewhat unbelievable, but I assure you, they’re all true (some are also probably lame and boring =). 
I decided to take it a step further and write them down, post the photos and invite comments to a new blog called[ Cold Locals](http://www.coldlocals.com/), named for the skate ‘zine that I tried to make around 1988-1989. 
It’s possible that I may cross post to here, but I have not totally decided on that aspect yet.

Check it out if you ever want to know why I am the way I am or you just have a load of time to waste.
