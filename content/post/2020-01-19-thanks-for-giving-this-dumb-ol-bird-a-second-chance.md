Revisited [Flash Gordon (1980)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080745/) again. I always loved the Vultan character played by [Brian Blessed](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080745/). Made with [Procreate](https://www.procreate.art) and Photoshop using the [True grit texture supply](https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/) brushes – beat Tones and Debaser Inkers, specifically. Based on a paused scene in which Voltan is commanding his hawkmen in battle. I always just liked when he says “Gordon’s Alive!?!” While stranded on Arboria.

Most of my stuff is pretty simplistic, based on something I can see, and usually turns out like a comic page or a silk screened skateboard graphic on a low quality run. There is definitely something nostalgic about it, though.
