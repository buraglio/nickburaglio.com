I spent some time making my Oktoberfest (yeah, I know I'm like months late) and decided it might be fun to try and film it to show others that it's actually pretty easy and economical to make a 5 gallon batch of home brewed beer. Well, after about an hour and a half of editing and a realization that my camera work for this one really kinda stunk, I was done and had a 30 minute "documentary". It's not the greatest and I have found a few places that I don't like the editing, but it's already uploaded to Google video (it was too big for YouTube). It's about 30 minutes long, so if you wanna watch it, be aware of that:  
  
\--Edit 4/17/2011, Google video had removed their content so this has been broken up and moved to youtube.
