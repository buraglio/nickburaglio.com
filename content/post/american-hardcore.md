I just read on a message board that I sometimes look at about a movie coming out based on the 2001 book [American Hardcore](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0922915717/sr=8-1/qid=1152885461/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-7856446-4511028?ie=UTF8) by [Steven Blush](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&field-author-exact=Steven%20Blush&rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/103-7856446-4511028). It looks pretty good as far as documentaries go, although there was talk of how the book was somewhat incorrect. Of course, it is based on one guy's experience as far as I know. I ordered the book today so I'll hopefully get that read before the film is out, if not I'll probably have to wait to see it. These are probably some of my favorite bands and types of music, although I came in after most of it was over in the late 80's, partially due to the fact that I was born in 1975 and partially because I lived in a small midwestern town of about 7000 people with no real ties to anywhere that anything groundbreaking was happening.
