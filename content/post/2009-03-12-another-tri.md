Several people have mentioned triathlons to me in the last 2 weeks, which has me thinking…..could my injury riddled body, damaged from years of skateboarding, distance running, boxing and submission wrestling handle another triathlon? 
I have not participated in one since 2006, and really not trained properly for one since 2005…..I have also not run any event runs or races since 2007 (or run at all since 2007 due to my very beat-to-hell back). Could I participate, perhaps not quite as competitively, in something like a sprint tri? 
I should be able to train very little and still have no issues with something like a sprint….at least in my mind. The last event run I ran I did without training at all and finished respectably.

My limitations are annoying me lately. No more boxing. No more running. No more skateboarding. 
Maybe I lived too hard, was too hard on my back and knees….who knows. I guess maybe I used up all of my “activity capital” when I was younger. 
I did get the ol skateboard out the other morning and kicked around, just to prove that I could still at least do a few tricks cold. It was also a decent excuse for messing with iMovie 09. Here are the results:

My back didn’t hurt *too* bad when I was done. I may try and do the local sprint tri this year. It’s short enough and easy enough that I can probably do it with minimal prep and and it may just satisfy my need to prove to myself that I’m not totally falling apart.
