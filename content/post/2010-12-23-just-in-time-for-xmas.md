Recommended by longtime pal [Sean](http://leytonbuzzards.wordpress.com/), I got a great holiday kick out of this.

<div>[Peace on Earth/Little Drummer Boy with Will Ferrell &amp; John C. Reilly](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/6f62088f27/peace-on-earth-little-drummer-boy-with-will-ferrell-john-c-reilly "from Will Ferrell, John C Reilly, Matt and Oz, Owen Burke, Shauna O'Toole, Kat Bardot, and FOD Team") from [Will Ferrell](http://www.funnyordie.com/will_ferrell)</div>And for those that like it a bit more inappropriate, I give you a scene from “Tramadol Nights”

Merry xmas 2010.
