Only 2.5 years after the original “[Beer making 101](http://bit.ly/br033p)” video was posted to Google Video was posted, I finally got some time to edit together a “Beer making 101, Bottling” segment. It was a bit thrown together, so the quality isn’t that great, and I had to edit out some stuff due to youtube’s 15 minute duration restriction, but you’ll get the basics.
