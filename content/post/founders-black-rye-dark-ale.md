A dark, hoppy, dry ale. I picked this up at the local Corkscrew in Urbana, IL for $1.89. It is pretty hoppy which is accented well by the slight rye flavor. The rye seems pretty apparent in the aftertaste, which is strong but not as long lasting as eating a piece of rye bread. Strong in taste but not in potency.
