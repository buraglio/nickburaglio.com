Sweet Cider (based on edwort's apfelwein)

  

1/13/2008

  

3 gallon batch

  

  

Use 100% Apple juice, no preservatives.  (Indian Summer is a good brand, I believe I used the generic equivalent that was readily available)

  

Added 1/3 gallon of 100% juice to 6.5 gallon carboy

Added 1/2 # of corn sugar to remaining amount in bottle.

Mixed (shook) until dissolved.  

Added remainder to carboy

Repeat 1x

Pitched 1 packet Nottingham ale yeast right through funnel

Added final gallon to carboy to wash down remaining yeast. 

  

I forgot to take a gravity reading at brew time =(

  

2/9/2008

Gravity is 1.001

  

Racked onto 32oz 100% raspberry juice into a 3 gallon carboy.

  

I had enough left over for 1 22oz bottle so I added ~1 oz of 100% apple juice (same brand) and bottled it.  

  

Initial impressions from tasking the reading sample:

It seems a little more cider-ish than Edwort's apfelwein but definitely sweeter.  Not overwhelmingly sweet, but like I expect a cider to be. 

  

I plan to let it sit another week or 2 and then bottle condition / carb.
