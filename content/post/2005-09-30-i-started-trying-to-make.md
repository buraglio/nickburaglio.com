<div></div>I started trying to make some packages for the [pfsense](http://www.pfsense.org/) platform. I’mnot really a developer and don’t know xml or php so I’m using this as an excuse to learn. My first attempt is with pftabled, a very useful c program for free and openbsd for manipulating pf tables remotely. First pass is available [here](http://buraglio.com/nick/projects/pfsense/pftabled.tgz)
