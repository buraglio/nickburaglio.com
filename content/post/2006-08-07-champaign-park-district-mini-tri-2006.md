I did the “24th annual” Champaign Park District mini-triathlon again this year. It’s a very short sprint triathlon that the Champaign Park District puts on every year, it’s usually pretty fun, being very short and very close to my house. I had originally planned on training for this at least a little, but alas, I didn’t. Overall I did ok, placing 83rd overall out of 350 with a final time of 48 minutes and 01 seconds. Not terrible I guess for not having trained anything but cycling since the sullivan triathlon. Total results can be found [here](http://www.secondwindrunningclub.org/RaceResults/2006/TriAge06.htm).  
The swim was a bit different this year. They had us start in the lazy river, which was, in my opinion, too shallow. I would estimate that 80% of the participants just walked though that part. After that, swimmers had to exit the water, run to the pool and finish in there. It was very odd and I think many didn’t like it. Personally, I didn’t care since thats my least favorite part anyway. We’ll see if they do it that way next year, I suspect that they’ll get rid of the lazy river leg of the swim.
