I’m a bit of a coffee nut. I love good, high quality coffee. I’ve written about it [many](http://www.nickburaglio.com/2013/12/27/greatest-coffee-mug-ive-ever-owned-16oz-contigo-autoseal-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-tumbler/ "Greatest coffee mug I’ve ever owned. (16oz Contigo Autoseal Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler)"), [many](http://www.nickburaglio.com/2009/01/02/coffee-facts/ "Coffee Facts"), [many](http://www.nickburaglio.com/2006/06/12/coffee-counteracts-alcohol-effects-on-liver/ "coffee counteracts alcohol effects on liver?"), [many](http://www.nickburaglio.com/2011/09/05/caffe-ladro/ "Caffe Ladro") times. In fact, I have a hard time getting going before coffee in the mornings, having been a coffee drinker since I was ~17 (I have no clue how my teeth aren’t stained; it baffles the dentist). I don’t drink soda, just coffee, water and beer. So, when [a kickstarter for the Hey Joe brewing coffee mug ](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/163685099/hey-joe-coffee-mug-brew-joe-on-the-go)was brought to my attention, I thought “wow, why has no one done this before?”. What is it, you ask? It’s a battery powered, heating, coffee brewing mug. That’s right.

My initial reaction to this was “ok, I need that. Now”.

Anyone that travels and appreciates good coffee could really benefit from this mug. I like an afternoon coffee, and when I’m traveling I have to find a decent place to get it and that is generally not an easy task because I like *good* coffee, and not over heated, burned coffee served too hot. I’ll often end up with what I call “gas station swill” which is a poor substitute for decent coffee. I partake in coffee when I’m traveling especially, and hotel coffee is…less than stellar.

Starbucks is….consistent. And over-roasted. And served too hot. And too expensive. I will always seek out a decent mom-and-pop shop but those are hit and miss.

I could see myself traveling with this thing. Lets hope it meets the kickstarter request, because, frankly, I want one. Check out the video if you don’t believe me.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Cool, right? </span>[Business Insider even thinks so.](http://www.businessinsider.com/hey-joe-coffee-mug-2014-6)<span style="line-height: 1.5em;"> I hope it gets funded, it really is a neat idea (and I want one, damnit!). I can name the number of things I’ve donated to on kickstarter on one hand. This is one of them. </span>
