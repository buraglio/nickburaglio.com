Drawing has never been something I was great at, but nevertheless it is something that I enjoy. Trying to do a little bit every day and learn some of the fundamentals that I never paid attention to in my drawing classes has been an uphill-both-ways-in-the-snow trudge. Shading and perspective have always alluded me as has true proper symmetry (hence why this is just half a head). I think most of this just takes practice, but I am positive there is a natural talent component to real, natural, from imagination drawing that I don’t quite have, too. I am finding that patience and attention to detail is a struggle, I get impatient and just want to move on to the next part, mostly for fear that I will obsess over something small and never finish, which then causes me to rush even more. This being an aspect that has always been a problem for me not just when I was in art school, but pretty much always, as very large blocks of personal time have always been at a premium.

I have really been liking the comic style shading using, at a suggestion be others, some [beat tones brushes](https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/products/bbeat-tones-halftone-brushes-for-photoshop).

This is what it ended up as. I figured maybe I could put some text in the upper left at some point.
