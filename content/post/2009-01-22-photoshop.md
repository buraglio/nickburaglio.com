There was once a day not so long ago when I had a wealth of knowledge about photography, photo equipment, color photo processors, digital image retouching and the hardware and software that it entailed. …..well, 11 years later and a lot of that has changed. When I was doing it, digital cameras were terrible. They didn’t even compare to a good SLR or medium format camera. So, I stuck with what I knew, emulsion based photography, and got passed up.   
My wonderful wife, after hearing me comment on not have a decent non-point-and-shoot digital camera, went and bought me a [Canon Digital Rebel XTi](http://tinyurl.com/aedp5l) for xmas of 2006. I love canon’s digital offering. The only problem was, all of my old photo lenses are Pentax based, as I liked Pentax for film. \[Does anyone want to buy some Pentax lenses?!?!? I have a bunch\]  
So, on to digital imaging.
