My back is feeling better and I've resumes training for my sprint triathlon. I have not yet really started back at boxing, jiu jitsu or wrestling but hopefully this thursday I'll be rolling with some friends from home. Speaking of home, the [Clinton Daily Journal](http://www.clintondailyjournal.com/) ran a story on us doing the ms150 bike tour. It didn't have the whole story online so I made a quick scan (above).
