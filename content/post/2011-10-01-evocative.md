A major TV network hit me with a nastygram telling me that my T-Shirt that I had made, and never sold or even bought for myself, was infringing on their copyright and trademark of a certain high school character played by [Mark-Paul Gosselaar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-Paul_Gosselaar) that carried a giant phone. I dare not even mutter the name, which was in the title of the shirt, for fear that the media giant come and take away my will to live.

<div>OK, I was probably naive in using the name. I profusely apologized and left the unsold product off the market. </div><div>The kicker, however, was that they claimed that the image, that was a picture of me (who looks NOTHING like [Mark-Paul Gosselaar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-Paul_Gosselaar)), was “evocative” of their copyright and trademark. </div><div>Wow, that is a stretch. A big stretch. Here is the text that I received:</div><div></div><div>*“We own the rights to the character “\[name I dare not mention out loud\]” and the design is still nonetheless <span>evocative</span> of our copyright and trademark. You have been put on notice. Thank you for your prompt compliance.”*  </div><div></div><div>For reference, here is the image, wholy created and owned by me (and also a picture OF me). </div><div></div><div>
