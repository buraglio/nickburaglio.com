Based on some comments in the thread of my [how to make simple mead how-to video](http://www.nickburaglio.com/2010/01/03/making-mead-a-simple-process/ "Making mead. A simple process."), I threw together this 1 gallon batch of "Sotasima" or "Finnish War mead" based on [this recipe](http://matiaswilkman.blogspot.com/2011/04/home-brew-scene.html). I, of course, took out the refined sugar and substituted honey. Here is the result: I don't think I'd make it again, it's very tart regardless of the fact that it's been bulk aging for a year and that I used a sweet yeast. It was a fun project, though!
