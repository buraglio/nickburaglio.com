"Hoagies and grinders, hoagies and grinders...navy beans, navy beans...MEATLOAF TRAVIS"

  

13 years after "Meatloaf Travis" was created (and pretty much worn out), I still think it's funny.

Unfortunately I think my brand of humor is really only funny to me (and maybe a small handful of others, Riegelo)

  

Inside jokes rule.
