<div></div>I made my request for a Verizon Treo 650 this week to replace my beat up Treo 600. After much researach and reading I came to the following accessories:

Plantronics Voyager 510 headset: [ $52.24](http://tinyurl.com/9zq79)

Spare Battery TRE650BAT $29.99  
Car Charger TRE650VPC $22.49  
Spec Skintight Holster [$34.95](http://tinyurl.com/am8r2)  
Screen protectors [$15.95](http://tinyurl.com/9e7pe)

These were heavily influenced by stuff I’ve seen other people with as well as reviews on [Treonauts](http://blog.treonauts.com/)  
I find this device, while a little large for my tastes, to be invaluable. I hate having a lot of crap with me but I need the functions of an organizer and the fact that there is decent speed internet access (1xRTT; roughly 144k) and a wealth of net apps that take advante of the net and even more that are just plain useful make it a “must consider” device for someone that needs help organizing themselves or just someone that likes gadgets.  
Here are some useful apps to wet your palet:

[KeyGTime+](http://mytreo.net/downloads/details-640.html?KeyguardTime%2B)

[KeyCaps600 (and 650)](http://www.geekandproud.net/software/keycaps650.php) KeyCaps650 lets you set your keys to generate capital letters when pressing twice (among other things).

[Profiles](http://www.kwik.cz/palm/treo/profiles/) Lets you control volume, color, brightness, keyguard, bean receive, and many more things.

A pretty good list of starter apps can be found [here](http://www.howardforums.com/archive/topic/629970-1.html).
