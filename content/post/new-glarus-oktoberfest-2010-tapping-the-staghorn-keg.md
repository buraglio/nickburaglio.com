We went up to New Glarus, WI this past weekend to celebrate Oktoberfest. It was a fun filled weekend with a lot of good beer and good friends. A bit more low key than I expected, which was all the more appealing to me. Below is some bad cell phone footage of Dan Carey (brewmaster of NewGlarus Brewing Company) tapping the wooden staghorn keg (cask?) that I shot with my phone after several mugs of Staghorn.  
  
  
  
  
  
It should also be noted that Dan was very approachable and personable, speaking with pretty much anyone that had questions, comments, etc.  
I must admit that being a very amateur home brewer I was a bit intimated by someone as skilled at his trade as Dan is, but he was very cool and nice to talk to. My wife even requested that the Cherry Stout be made a regular offering (or at least made again).
