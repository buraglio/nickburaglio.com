<div></div>I did the Sullivan, IL Triathlon this sunday (4/30/06). It was REALLY windy with gusts of up to 37mph, which really sucked for the bike ride. I was hoping to ride my new Bianchi but it wasn’t done yet. I did ok, my knees were burning up so I didn’t time as well as I’d hoped but still finished with a respectable time (especially for someone who barely trained). Detals can be found [here](http://www.onlineraceresults.com/race/view_individual.php?make_printable=1&bib_num=214&race_id=3182&type=result).

I also bought a new car last week (it’s been a busy week). The old Beretta that I inherited from Rebecca was having some fairly serious problems so we decided to get me a new car. I was on the fence regarding what exactly to buy, I knew I wanted a subaru but didn’t know which one. I wanted something with room to haul stuff but the forester seemed just a little too big and the Outback seemed too much like a wagon. The Imprezia was attractive but a little too small so I drove an imprezia outback sport and it was perfect. Small, good gas mileage, but lots of room.
