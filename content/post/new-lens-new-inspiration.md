I got a new lens for my Canon XTi.....a [Canon EF 50mm f/1.8](http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU). Not the most expensive piece of photo equipment, but pretty much a no brainer at $98 for what it gets you.  I've shot some pretty darned good images with used, low to medium quality pawn shop lenses, so it seemed like a no-thought decision.  
 Art is all about subject and inspiration, not equipment quality and technical prowess. Thats something that many folks have a hard time grasping in the photography and video art world.  
I'm not saying Im great at anything, but I do find it very mentally therapeutic to get out my sketch pad or camera and just capture stuff (not as much as some good submission grappling, but pretty close).  
  
I've really been getting back into shooting images lately, only 4 years after my wonderful wife encouraged it by getting me a digital replacement for my old, metal bodied Pentax 1000 that I used before and all through college.  Keep an eye on my [flickr photostream](http://www.buraglio.com/pics) if you're interested, I have been publishing quite a bit.
