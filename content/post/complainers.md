Several folks have complained that my daily [twitter](http://twitter.com/buraglio) summaries are a bit too chatty. So, to satisfy the few folks that actually subscribe to the [rss](feed:http://buraglio.com/nick/feed) of this blog (that I rarely have time to update lately, thus the twitter feed), I have moved it back to a weekly summary.  
There. Stop complaining.
