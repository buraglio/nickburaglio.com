These are some of the funniest commercials I’ve seen in a while. Hikers play pranks on an unsuspecting but easily angered bigfoot. I’ve only seen them on spiketv but I hope to see them on others stations soon since they’re so simpe yet so entertaining.

There are links to more of them [here](http://www.messinwithsasquatch.com/)
