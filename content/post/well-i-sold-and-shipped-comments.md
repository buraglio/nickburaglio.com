Thanks a lot for the helpful write-up. It is also my belief that mesothelioma cancer has an extremely long latency time, which means that the signs of the disease may not emerge till 30 to 50 years after the primary exposure to asbestos. Pleural mesothelioma, and that is the most common type and affects the area round the lungs, could potentially cause shortness of breath, chest pains, plus a persistent coughing, which may produce coughing up bloodstream.
