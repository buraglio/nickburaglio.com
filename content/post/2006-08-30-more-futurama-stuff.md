I just came across this (I know, it’s old).

I was/am a huge [futurama ](http://www.gotfuturama.com/)fan, so news of the dvd movies and possible return with 13 new episodes was very nice. This nice little clip for the movie[ “An Inconvenient Truth” ](http://www.climatecrisis.net/) was also good (since I happen to subscribe to a great deal of what [the movie ](http://www.nickburaglio.com/inconvenient)says).
