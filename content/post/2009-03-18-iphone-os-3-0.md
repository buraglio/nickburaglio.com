Finally, finally, finally. The iPhone 3.0 OS that was [announced this week](http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/03/17/iphone-os-30-screenshot-walkthrough/) is **finally** adding features that the original iPhone should have had. Features that some of which, other than a software addition, were always possible, not new, but nonetheless unavailable.   
The features include:  
Exchange 2007 remote search support  
[MMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service)  
Copy/Paste   
Read and compose email and text messages in landscape  
…among many others.

We’ve finally stepped out to 2004 with the addition of [MMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service). [MMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service) is a luxury, I agree, but i used to use the heck out of it and the fact that it wasn’t available on such an elegant device such as the iPhone was, frankly, stupid. The argument that we should “email photos” holds no water since (being very generous) only 20% of people have smartphones that can get email.   
Copy/Paste is also not new, but was something that I could understand not being in the first rev of the iPhone. The touchscreen implementation was completely new and I’m sure it was hard to get that aspect just right. A little late, but Kudos, apple.   
Exchange 2007 remote search support….ehh, I don’t really care that much but I may care more if I have to switch to exchange for work email. Lets just hope we can have more than one [ActiveSync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveSync) account since now [google offers a push calendar solution](http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/) that I’m pretty much fully invested in.

[Official apple page](http://www.apple.com/iphone/preview-iphone-os/) on the subject.

This looks pretty slick. I can’t wait.
