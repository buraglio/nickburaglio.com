Sweet Cider (based on edwort’s apfelwein)

<div></div><div>1/13/2008</div><div></div><div>3 gallon batch</div><div></div><div></div><div>Use 100% Apple juice, no preservatives. (Indian Summer is a good brand, I believe I used the generic equivalent that was readily available)</div><div></div><div>Added 1/3 gallon of 100% juice to 6.5 gallon carboy</div><div>Added 1/2 # of corn sugar to remaining amount in bottle.</div><div>Mixed (shook) until dissolved. </div><div>Added remainder to carboy</div><div>Repeat 1x</div><div>Pitched 1 packet Nottingham ale yeast right through funnel</div><div>Added final gallon to carboy to wash down remaining yeast. </div><div></div><div>I forgot to take a gravity reading at brew time =(</div><div></div><div>2/9/2008</div><div>Gravity is 1.001</div><div></div><div>Racked onto 32oz 100% raspberry juice into a 3 gallon carboy.</div><div></div><div>I had enough left over for 1 22oz bottle so I added ~1 oz of 100% apple juice (same brand) and bottled it. </div><div></div><div>Initial impressions from tasking the reading sample:</div><div>It seems a little more cider-ish than Edwort’s apfelwein but definitely sweeter. Not overwhelmingly sweet, but like I expect a cider to be. </div><div></div><div>I plan to let it sit another week or 2 and then bottle condition / carb. </div><div></div><div> </div>
