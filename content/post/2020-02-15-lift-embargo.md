Many years ago I [wrote about my love for dystopian, apocalyptic movies ](https://nickburaglio.com/2013/03/17/top-5-post-apocalyptic-movies/)with the [Mad Max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max) series being right at the top of that genre. For me, nostalgia value for this series is very high. I recall watching “[The Road Warrior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_2)” on my parents console TV in my basement as a kid and marveling as [Lord Humongous](https://madmax.fandom.com/wiki/Lord_Humungus) relentlessly attempted to get his hands on the “guzzaline”. “They be refninin’! ka-chunk, ka-chunk”, as so eloquently stated by the pilot. Years later I would see “[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max_Beyond_Thunderdome)” in the Clintonia theater and be re-invigorated by the story – even if a friend has recently equated it to a wasteland Peter Pan.

As part of my “trying to do something creative more often” phase, I have made this quick illustration of “Master” of “[Master-Blaster](https://madmax.fandom.com/wiki/Master_Blaster)”
