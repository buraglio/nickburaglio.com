Image manipulation via either [Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/compare/), [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/), or whatever is a wonderful tool and can provide hours of entertainment. In keeping with the skateboarding theme of the last few days, I decided to mess a little with some of the images and came up with this:

| <span>So retro! So old school! Wow, it’s a xeroxed image!</span> |

Reminiscent of the old do-it-yourself style that was so common in early skateboarding, I just had to have this image from the archives on a some sort of apparel. 
Through the magic and wonder that is the internet, I had nearly instant gratification. A [Short Sleeved T- Shirt](http://tinyurl.com/87fo5d), a [long sleeved T-Shirt](http://tinyurl.com/a9cwbu), and even the always stylish [hooded sweatshirt](http://tinyurl.com/8gn979). Now you can show your colors if you were a Clinton or Wapella, Illinois skateboarder from the early days.
