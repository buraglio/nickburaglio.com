I have not been to florida in june in several years. It's certainly as hot as I remember. It's no qonder that the baseball game SCinet took us to was in an enclosed, air conditioned stadium. I never knew that baseball could be like that! Traveling for 2 days, returning just in time to drive to the ms150 in DeKalb, IL. It's (been) a busy week.
