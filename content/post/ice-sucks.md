Check out how slick this road is! Crazy. It looks like a game of bumper cars and seems to go on forever:  
  
  
  
  
Speaking of crummy weather, my less-than-a-year-old subaru had a branch fall on it this weekend and literally shatter out the hatchback window due to high winds. Very uncool, very inconvenient. It had to be a freak thing, the place it hit was right above the body, which basically took out the entire back window. Not fun. At least there was very minimal body damage.

Fun, huh?
