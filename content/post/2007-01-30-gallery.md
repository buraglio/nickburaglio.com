I finally got my photos moved over to a [Gallery Install](http://www.buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/) and stored in a nice postgres database…. iPhoto is the bomb, there are so many plugins that make it useful. [iphoto2gallery](http://zwily.com/iphoto/) is a marvelous tool. Kudos to the author, it’s very useful. There are also shutterfly exports, picasaweb export plugins, the list goes on and on. I guess I’m just spoiled by the fact that I never have to use a windows box.  
I figured I’d use the fact that Rebecca got me a Canon EOS Rebel XTI for xmas as a driving factor…(and WOW does it take nice images!), not to mention the fact that we’ve got a new friend in the house.
