I'm liking the move back to blogger so far. I do miss some of the flexibility that wordpress gave me, but overall I'm willing to trade that for not running a database server anymore.  Blogger is available over [IPv6](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6) using the [google over any v6](http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/) resolvers, which is very cool, and the VPS I moved to at [ARP networks](https://www.arpnetworks.com/) to host DNS and basic HTTP is also fully v6 native.  
I'm also really, really liking the move to [flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio/) for my photo hosting.  I paid for a pro account and have been very pleased with the integration and wealth of tools and apps.  
I have to say, though, that the entire reason that this move was spawned (other than the fact that I've been thinking about it for a while) is that I installed an app called [PicPush](http://blog.350nice.com/wp/products/picpush) on my Android Nexus One .  
This app allows me to automatically publish all images taken with my android device with 0 user intervention (and allows for a timer to to so; I have mine set to 15 minutes).  
[Here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio/sets/72157624667024904/) you can find all of the images in my "Mobile" flickr set.  There are things in there from as far back as my Treo 600, but most of the stuff is relatively new and always updating as I snap images.
