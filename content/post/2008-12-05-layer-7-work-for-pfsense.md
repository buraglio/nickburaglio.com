I’m not really sure how I missed [this](http://roadtoqos.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/the-layer7-interface/), probably because it’s some students doing the work, but nevertheless, it’s very exciting. 
This is something that has been unavailable for the most part under \*BSD, but [available for quite some time under Linux](http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/). I personally don’t like iptables and find it much less elegant than pf, both in implementation and practice so seeing this work is very encouraging and I can’t wait to test it out. 
Adding this into [pfSense](http://pfsense.org/) is a very exciting thing!

Add [this blog](http://roadtoqos.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/the-layer7-interface/feed/) to your RSS reader to keep track!

BGP, QoS, L7, pf, CARP (and OSPF if I can get off my butt and finish the GUI), [pfSense](http://pfsense.org/) is going to take over the world!
