I enjoy beer. I don’t drink as much of it as I used to, but on occasion I like to down a few good ones (I’ll also down a few bad ones if that is all there is). I wouldn’t say I’m a “Beer Snob” as I’ve been known to drink anything from PBR, Natural Lite and Stag to a $12 imported porter. I’m not normally a big fan of the lighter stuff but I came across this ale, Smithwick’s. It’s just the right blend if what I like. A little bite but smooth at the end. From [Realbeer.com](http://www.realbeer.com/):  
“Made by Guinness in Ireland, Smithwick’s is inspired by John Smithwick’s original recipe, which was first brewed at St. Francis Abbey in Kilkenny, Ireland. St. Francis Abbey has been in operation since 1710, making it one of Ireland’s oldest breweries.”  
I’d recommend trying this if you can find it (which has been my problem as of late). It’s smooth enough that a casual light beer drinker would probably enjoy it but flavorful enough that even a beer snob probably wouldn’t snicker. I’d really like to find some more of it, I had a 6 pack given to me and I just finished off the last one. I’ve tried looking online as well as every local place in Champaign-Urbana, Bloomington and other surrounding Central Illinois towns with no success. I hear tale that it’s found primarily in larger cities, St. Louis, Chicago, etc., but last time I looked in STL it I couldn’t find it there either (granted I didn’t look that hard). If anyone knows somewhere in Central IL (or online) that I can order this please let me know. I’d love to get my hands on some more.
