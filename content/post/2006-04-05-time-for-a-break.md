Well, Triathlon season is starting up so I won’t be doing a lot of drinking. I may make a post here and there but I don’t expect to be doing any kind of regular review till early September when all the races and training start to die down. On a lighter note, I came across 2 cases of Smithicks! Sadly, most of it is going ot have to wait a while before it gets to be enjoyed (unless my wife drinks it all!)
