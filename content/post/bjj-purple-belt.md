This week I received a Purple belt in [Brazilian Jiu Jitsu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BJJ) under [Jack McVicker](http://www.jackmcvicker.com/). Having trained in bjj since about 2002 under [Jack](http://www.jackmcvicker.com/), it was a very great honor to receive this promotion. Training with the high level guys that I work with several times a week certainly helps progression of skill and technique, of course having great instruction doesn't hurt either.

So, since bjj.org is pretty much gone and their "Instructor Lineages" page has gone with it, here is the progression of my rank:  
[Helio Gracie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helio_gracie) => [Rickson Gracie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rickson_Gracie) => [Wellington "MegaTon" Dias](http://www.teammegaton.net/) => [Jack McVicker](http://www.jackmcvicker.com/) => [Me](http://buraglio.com/nick/) (Purple Belt).
