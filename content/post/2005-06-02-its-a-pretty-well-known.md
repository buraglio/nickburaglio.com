<div></div>It’s a pretty well known fact that I like Apple computers and most people have seen a lot of the spam and ads referring to getting a free mac mini or a free ipod. I always thought they were BS. A scam attempt to harvest email addresses or another version of something nasty. 
Well, interestingly enough, I actually know someone who really DID get the free Mac Mini, I saw it. He already had one, and sold the one he got for free for ~$500 and bought an ipod photo. I was flabbergasted. I couldn’t believe that it actually worked. There had to be a catch, and in fact, there was. 
I decided that I was going to read up on it, after all, there are tons of people selling this info on ebay, posting it on web forums, etc. Maybe I’d a actually give it a try. What the hell, right? After doing a little reading it looked to me like it was some kind of a pyramid scheme. I signed up at [ FreeMiniMacs.com ](http://www.freeminimacs.com/) with a [ GMail](http://www.gmail.com/) account I use for stuff like this and had at it. 
You have to complete an “offers” meaning that you have to sign up for something. THEN, you need to refer (I believe) 10 people to do the same. For what it’s worth, my link is [here](http://www.freeminimacs.com/?r=14799159). 
We’ll see how long this takes…..if it ever completes.
