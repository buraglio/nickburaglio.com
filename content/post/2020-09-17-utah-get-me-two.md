Continuing with the art, I have done a bit more with procreate app. I added a handful of commercial brushes and textures, notably some from [TrueGrit Texture supply](https://www.truegrittexturesupply.com/) and [VisualTimmy](https://visualtimmy.com/?ref=nolbz1lvsewm). I’ve done a few things for folks and a bunch more for myself. A few of the more notable designs follow.

As the title suggests – a Point break reference. This one is one of my favorites. I plan to draw in my friends head to all 4 presidents.

 In keeping with the theme of 80s and 90s movies – This one came about after a friend suggested I watch the[ Harry Dean Stanton documentary](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372776/). Even though [HDS](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2372776/) has been in sooooo many classics (Repo Man, Escape from New York, Alien….this list goes on seemingly forever)The first thing I think of is the scene from Red Dawn where he’s screaming “Avenge me!”.

“Dog” A hastily drawn design of my dog after one fo the boys put these funky glasses on it.
