As many know, I love T-Shirts, and the only thing better than a great T-Shirt, is a great shirt from a classic 80’s movie of my childhood.   
Thank goodness there is [ Found Item Clothing](http://founditemclothing.com/). These guys recreate so many of the shirts from classic pop culture and just all around great movies (they also have a pretty good [movie/dvd review section](http://www.founditemclothing.com/itgoesto11/index.php)).  
Anyway, in keeping with their awesome tradition, they’ve released even more new [shirts](http://founditemclothing.com/t-shirt-menu.html). I mean, come on, where else are you going to find the shirt that [Jack Burton](http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011933/) wore in [Big Trouble in Little China](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/) or the [Skeleton shirt](http://founditemclothing.com/t-shirts/spinal-tap-skeleton-shirt.html) from [This is Spinal Tap](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/) pains takingly recreated in every detail?

Hell, I got the [Bunny Slippers](http://www.bunnyslippers.com/bunny-slippers/classic-bunny-slippers.php) from [Real Genius ](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/)for my wife last year for xmas.

Well, my friends, they’ve done it again.

——Drum Roll———

May I introduce the [Teen Wold Styles Life Sucks shirt](http://founditemclothing.com/t-shirts/teen-wolf-life-sucks-shirt.html)

As well as [Booger’s Greasy Tony’s shirt.](http://founditemclothing.com/t-shirts/booger-greasy-tonys-shirt.html)
