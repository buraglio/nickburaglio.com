I have recently been particularly inspired by some folks that I find to be incredibly talented – notably Mash -up master “[Butcher Billy](https://www.instagram.com/thebutcherbilly/)“, prolific skate and multidisciplinary artist [Tim Baron](https://www.instagram.com/timbaronart/), as well as comic style artist [Felipe Flores](https://www.instagram.com/felipeflorescomics/), and [Super7](https://super7.com/), the company that makes all of the great stuff from our youth. I wanted to make an homage to my youth. I \*loved\* the “[Back to the Future](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/)” movie. Fourth grade me had the jean jacket and a puffy vest. I got my first skateboard – an event that would later shape my entire life – based on that movie. I also loved Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. As *very* young teenagers, that movie was a first date for my eventual wife and myself. So, with some [Procreate](https://www.procreate.art) and Photoshop work, a lot of reference material, and a load of how-to videos on technique…here is my “[Marty McFly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_McFly)” trading card.
