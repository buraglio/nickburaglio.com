I went to [Joint Techs](http://jointtechs.es.net/) in Madison, Wi this week. Overall it was pretty good, I learned a lot of stuff and experienced a lot of the dynamics of some major networking initiatives. Madison is a great city, I’d never been there and Rebecca had been saying it was really funa nd beautiful. She was right. Pics from the event can be found [here](http://buraglio.com/pics/ncsa/JointTechs-Madison2006/). They were all taken with my treo so they’re not the greatest. I had Blatz on tap and even brought home a 12 pack of it. I also had some of the best fish I’ve had in a while, overall it was a good trip.
