Dark and smokey (hence the name) and more hoppy than I expected. This is a good beer, sharp and not sweet like I expected. Brewed by otter creek brewing company and good with food. I enjoyed mine with dinner and the dinner I had really complimented the robust flavor. I'm not sure of the alcohol content but I picked mine up at the local piccadilly as a 6 pack and was buzzed after 2. Recomended for something a little different.
