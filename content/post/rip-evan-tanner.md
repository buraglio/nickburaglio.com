I always enjoyed watching Evan Tanner fight and really liked his aggressive style.  He had a great ground-and-pound game but was a much more well rounded fighter as well as an interesting person than what most MMA fans saw.  Anyone that read his personal blog on any regular basis saw that he was both a charismatic and gifted person and troubled individual. I never had a chance to meet him in person but the game and the world will surely miss such a unique individual.
