What a sweet little boo. Sorry for your loss my friend. I think I live by this unknown authors words: "heaven will not ever Heaven be Unless my cats are there to welcome me." And for people like you I think are best described by the following: "We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals." â€“ Immanual Kant
