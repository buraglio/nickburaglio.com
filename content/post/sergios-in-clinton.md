We went down to Clinton tonight to see some family and take care of some stuff. We decided to make an evening of it and wanted to head back to Sergio's for dinner.

This place is one of the best kept secrets of my home town of Clinton, IL. Sergio's mexican restaraunt has the absolutely undisputed best burritos i've ever had. Their $4.85 burrito is the size of a labamba super and their $9 burrito....well it needs it's own zip code. I'd seriously be surprised if it weighed less than 5lbs. Plan on eating it for more than one meal. If you ever get the chance, stop by there. you won't regret it. They're open 10am to 10pm tues - sat. ![](http://buraglio.com/nick/images/sergiosburrito.jpg)  
Above is a pic I snapped with my treo, it's of the regular ($4.85) chicken burrito. I had a hard time finishing it. I've only seen a $9 on one occasion, it was frighteningly heavy and a huge burrito.
