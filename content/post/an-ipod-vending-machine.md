In the airport in Minneapolis, MN there were at LEAST 2 vending machines (in the American Airlines terminal) for iPods. I literally did a double take, then wished I would have come up with the idea. Put your credit card in and get any model of ipod, from shuffle to 80gig video. They also had accessories, chargers, and prepaid cingular mobile phones. Put in your credit card and get an ipod, it was actually pretty slick.
