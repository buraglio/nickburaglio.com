I saw this over at my [brother's blog](http://mike.buraglio.com/2010/10/walking-dead-trailer.html), and it looks pretty amazing. I'm a really big fan of zombie and post-apocalyptic stuff and this appears to have high potential. I've not read the [graphic novels](http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Dead-Graphic-Novel-Collection/lm/R3DLKI0S20B6L6) (although I will be obtaining it and reading it before the premiere), but if Mike says it's good, it probably is.  
AMC has been pumping out some really good stuff, lets hope this lives up to the trailer.
