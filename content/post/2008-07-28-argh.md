I’m a little frustrated with the WordPress conversion, overall I think it’s probably better than movable type, but the primary driver for making the changeover was so that I could use the mobile support that came out for the iPhone. Well, I seem to be running into a fairly common bug in it, in that it doesn’t seem to be able to read my configuration or write to my pages. 
I’m quite confident that it is either 
a. something I need to tweak, or 
b. something that will be fixed soon if it is in fact a bug. 
I’ll probably did a little deeper into it tonight to make sure that it isn’t a problem on my end.

Either way, I’m looking forward to being able to shoot photos up here directly from my iPhone…. 
It should be fun.
