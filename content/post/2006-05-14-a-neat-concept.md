Even thought I just bought a new one, I really like the idea of not using a car, but instead being able to do day-to-day stuff on a bicycle. There are several reasons I feel this way, the first being that I strongly dislike being in a car. It’s not that comfortable (yes, I’m even talking about luxury cars), they’re expensive, gas prices are out-freakin-rageous, and the excercise you get on a bike is good for you. Not to mention it’s better for the environment.  
I ride my bike to work whenever weather permits, I think more people should do the same. I think that the guys over at [Xtracycle](http://www.xtracycle.com/) have a novel idea. An SUB, sport utility bicycle. They’re ugly, but they look like they could work well for for carrying around day-to-day stuff.
