I've been thinking about moving this blog over to movable type due to the more user friendly and extendable nature of it, even though I don't like the idea of a mysql backend (my old MT install just uses sqlite).  With the useful iphone support and ease of use It just seems like the right thing to do.....and since it's already pretty much done, here it is.  Note the cheery default color scheme (6/27/2008, it's probably going to change.....)
