Since I’ve aggravated a (likely very old) back injury once again and can’t train or work out nearly as much as I used to until it’s healed, I have decided to try my hand at making beer….and wine (or is it cider?)….and mead….

I’ve gone a little overboard.

I’ve bottled my [first batch](http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/English-Brown-Ale/), an English Brown ale, and after bottle conditioning for about 2 weeks it’s actually pretty darned good. Nice and clear, not cloudy like I would have expected. I got a little anxious waiting for the beer so I threw together[ a spiced orange mead](http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/Ancient-Orange-Mead/) based on the recipe [Ancient Orange Cinnamon &amp; Clove Mead](http://www.moremead.com/mead_logs/Ancient_OCC.html).

Cut to 3 weeks later….I now have a [Vanilla Porter](http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/VanillaPorter/), a batch of [Apfelwein](http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/apfelwein/) and a 1 Gallon batch of [Cherry Grape Mead](http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/CherryGrapeMead/).

I can’t wait to try the porter, it should be great. The apfelwein I’ll likely give away most of unless Rebecca likes it since I don’t really drink wine or cider (plus I have 5 gallons of it!).

I’m very excited about the mead. I’ve really only had mead once and I enjoyed the flavor very much.

I’ve found some really good resources for brewing, too. [How to brew](http://www.howtobrew.com/) (site and book) has everything any beginning (or experienced) brewer would ever want to know. The message board [Home Brew Talk](http://homebrewtalk.com/) also has a wealth of very knowledgeable and friendly folks over there. I’ve found that site to be indispensable so far.  
It’s a fun hobby. I find myself spending a lot of time at night reading recipes and techniques then itching to try them out…
