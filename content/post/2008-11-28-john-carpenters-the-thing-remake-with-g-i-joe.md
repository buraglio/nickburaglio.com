This was brought to my attention by [Mike Aref AKA JokerJitsu](http://www.jokerjitsu.com/) and I HAD to post it. It is too good to *not* watch. Iâ€™m a big [John Carpenter](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/) fan and having [The Thing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/) remade using G.I. Joe characters, with the care that was used to do this deserves talking about.
