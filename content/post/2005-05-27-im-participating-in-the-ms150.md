<div></div>I’m participating in the ms150 in Illinois this year. For anyone that doesn’t know, [ More info can be found here](http://events.msillinois.org/site/PageServer?pagename=05MS150_det_home). My cousin has MS, which really sucks. I figure after all the stupid and selfish shit I’ve done over the years maybe I should try give a little back. A few days of riding a bike is a small price to lay for the funds that get raised to help research this.  
Jeff Buraglio has organized an [entire team ](http://teamremarkable.org/) of folks riding. I think this is something I may do again next year, I’m kinda getting into this training thing. If you are willing to [ donate to sponsor me](https://secure2.convio.net/msil/site/Donation?ACTION=SHOW_DONATION_OPTIONS&CAMPAIGN_ID=1161&PROXY_ID=1189673&FR_ID=1060&JServSessionIdr001=34vgpd9hg1.app1b) please do, it’s for a good cause and is tax deductible.  
I’ll be riding the [new Trek](http://www2.trekbikes.com/Bikes/City_Bike_Path/Hybrid/FX/7300_FX/index.php) that [Rebecca](http://www.buraglio.com/rebecca/) got me for our 5 year anniversary. Rebecca will also be riding this year in this fine event (on her [new Trek](http://www2.trekbikes.com/Bikes/City_Bike_Path/Hybrid/Hybrid/7300/index.php)). We got them both at [champaign cycle](http://www.champaigncycle.com/). I highly recommend them.  
On the same note, I’ve kinda been wanting to get another BMX bike after seeing my friends Mark’s. I almost bought a free agent on ebay the other day……..
