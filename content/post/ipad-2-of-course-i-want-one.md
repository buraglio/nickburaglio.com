I got a 64Gig Ipad for xmas. I love it. I use it all of the time for work, at the gym (for watching video on the bike) at home and on the road.  
It's a great device, even though I was underwhelmed when it forst came out. After using it a bit I realized that it's like a hybrid between my iPhone and my MacBook. A more convenient device for quick but more detailed work or entertainment.  
  
Now, merely 2 months after I got mine, there is a new one. I knew that would happen, thats the way tech stuff always works, especially apple. Do I want the new one, of course. I'm like a kid when it comes to gadgets. Will I get the one one? Not likely. I's more likely that I'll wait until iPad 3.  
  
I found [this Conan O'Brien skit](http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/04/conan-obrien-produces-a-more-honest-ipad-2-promotional-video/) pretty entertaining given my "iPad circumstance"
