According to [engadget mobile](http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2008/11/01/atandt-planning-femtocell-trial-later-this-year/), AT&T may be following suit and begin testing [Femtocells](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtocell). This is great news for anyone in a marginal coverage area that is able to get terrestrial broadband.  
I, for one, would love to test one (especially if it meant I could finally have 3g).
