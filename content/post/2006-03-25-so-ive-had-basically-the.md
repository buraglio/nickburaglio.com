<div></div>So I’ve had basically the same palmos environment for about 4 years now. From my Sony Clie to my Treo600 to my Treo650 I’ve just done a sync when I got me new device and been done with it. I know, being a technical person I should know better, and I did, but I’m sometimes lazy when I shouldn’t be. It was the 2gig SD card that I got for $80 at Circuit City that made me do it. I want to be able to keep TV episodes on it and there was something that was causing a nasty reboot every time I tried to play an mp3 or a video with mp3 audio. Well, I got crazy the other night, did a few backups and blanked the device. I then did a sync of JUST my calendar and contacts. So far, so good. When it came time to start adding apps I found that a lot of the stuff in my “archive” directory was not \*really\* being used. I decided to do an additive approach. I’ve so far only added apps to the RAM that I know I use every day. First things first. An uninstall manager. This will keep track of any stray apps I install and all their weird tmp files for possible later removal. This is very important (so I’ve read) so I did it.

The first app I loaded was [callfilter](http://www.velocityware.com/callfilter/cfinfo.htm) . This is a \_MUST\_ have app if you get a lot of calls and or txt messages. It’s like a firewall for you phone, or an electronic receptionist. There are so many useful features in this app that I get excited just thinking about it. Buy it, it’s worth every penny. I then loaded [simpe profile manager](http://www.palmgear.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=software.showsoftware&prodid=55044) which is FREE and integrates right with callfilter. Both apps together are an unstoppable juggernaut. Powerrun came next. It allows for the easy and clean use of apps from the SD card. TCPMP is also a MUST have app. How else will I watch episides of scrubs that I pull off the tivo and compress? After the rest was installed (pssh, Toccer, BackupBuddy). Overall I have 18mb free now where I used to have 4. Everything works great. This was \_long\_ overdue.
