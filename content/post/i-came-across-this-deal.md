I came across this deal at [slickdeals.net](http://slickdeals.net/). [Yahoo has domain purchases for $1.99 per year](http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/domains/?p=CRUISE). Normally I use [godaddy](http://godaddy.com/) but this was too good of a deal to pass up. I picked up nickburaglio.com again (I had let it lapse back in like 2000) for a couple of years for under $4.00 and moved the blog over to it. Not too bad of a deal for a self indulgent domain such as this.  
On a less entertaining note, I noticed that all my i386 boxes that I own (which are old to begin with) are pretty much dead except one. It sucks since I'd really like to have a nice machine to run freebsd on. I wouldn't want to run it on one of my macs and miss out on OS X.
