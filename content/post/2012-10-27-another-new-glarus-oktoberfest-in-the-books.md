We didn’t get to go last year due to my son Zach being born….this year we were determined to makeit up for the staghorn cask tapping. Well, we were successful. It seemed a bit more low key this year, but the food was amazing and the beers were…..better than can be described. The staghorn cask was wow-factor good.

Here is a little video of the cask tapping I stitched together.
