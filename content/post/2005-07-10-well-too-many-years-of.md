<div></div>Well, too many years of skateboarding have taken their toll on my 30 year old body. An old injury from ~10 years ago has once again reared it’s ugly head. After doing my normal [Saturday morning workout](http://www.jackmcvicker.com/academy.html) and doing one 5 minute round my back started to tighten up. By the time I had gotten home I could barely get out of the car. So much for training hard for the [mini triathlon](http://www.champaignparkdistrict.com/sports/minitri/) that I’m (hopefully still) doing. Now that I can’t get off the chair I’ve been really scouring the net for other little activities I can do. If I can get back to training soon I think I may also try to do the [duathlon in Charleston, IL](http://www.bikeandhikeweb.com/text/events.htm). Who knows, I hope to feel better in a few days. 
I’ve also been looking at getting a road bike. Champaign Cycles has some REALLY good deals on both the [Trek 1200](http://www.trekbikes.com/bikes/2004/road/1200.jsp) and [Trek 1000](http://www.trekbikes.com/bikes/2004/road/1000.jsp). They also have a good price on a Lemond that is my size.
