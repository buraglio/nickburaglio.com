It was fun wasn't it! I have a bunch of photos from the weekend on my website www.suepics.com in the Oktoberfest Gallery.

Those are some great images. I saw a few people doing some photography at Oktoberfest and I was lamenting the fact that I didn't bring any of my camera gear.

Hello. I have checked your nickburaglio.com and i see you've got some duplicate content so probably it is the reason that you don't rank high in google. But you can fix this issue fast. There is a tool that generates content like human, just search in google: miftolo's tools

After reading your blog post, I browsed your website a bit and noticed you aren’t ranking nearly as well in Google as you could be. I possess a handful of blogs myself, and I think you should take a look at "seowebsitetrafficnettools", just google it. You’ll find it’s a very lovely SEO tool that can bring you a lot more visitors and improve your ranking. They have more than 30+ tools only 20$. Very cheap right? Keep up the quality posts
