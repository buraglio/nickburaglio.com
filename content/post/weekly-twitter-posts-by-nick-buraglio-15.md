*   @[jlivingood](http://twitter.com/jlivingood) I absolutely would test IPv6. I've been using it 4 years via a tunnel at home and natively at work. It needs to be everywhere [in reply to jlivingood](http://twitter.com/jlivingood/statuses/8170983192) [#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/8192538543)
  
*   @[jlivingoodand](http://twitter.com/jlivingoodand) re: IPv6, I could name 10 other highly technical ppl throughout the US that would actually use it and give \*useful\* feedback. [#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/8193353367)
