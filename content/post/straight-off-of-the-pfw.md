Straight off of the [pfw](http://www.allard.nu/pfw/) mailing list: [http://www.allard.nu/pfw/blocklists/](http://www.allard.nu/pfw/blocklists/)  
I had written some bad perl code that did something similar, importing and munging the data in the PeerGuardian list and installing in in a pf table, so far this looks much better. I'm anxious to check this out and am hoping to make it work easily with [pfsense](http://www.pfsense.org/).
