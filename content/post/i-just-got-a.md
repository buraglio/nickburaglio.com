I just got a [helix face in belt clip holster](http://cgi.ebay.com/TREO-650-FACE-IN-HELIX-BELT-CLIP-HOLSTER-HIGH-QUALITY_W0QQitemZ5870074142QQcategoryZ108586QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem) and I must say it's pretty nice. It does not protect the treo like a cover or a sleeve but it is "face  
in" which is pretty nice for someone that bumps their phone on a lot of stuff. It comes with 2 clips  
that can be interchanged. It's a cheap alternative to the Seidio case, the only differences I can  
find other than the clips are the seidio has a felt type inside and the Helix uses very soft, supple  
plastic.  
I believe the helix may have a little better hold on the bottom of the device but I don't have a  
Seidio to compare to.  
One BIG plus of this case, like the Seidio, it is very compact. It holds the device very close to the body, not hanging out where it can be easily bumped and hit. The helix also comes with a changeable clip, one lower profile (the one I prefer) and one that it detachable. A nice little spin on a pretty good case. It allows access to all the botom ports and all the top ports if you like to leave your treo in a case when not wearing it.  
The only cons that I have found are that, on occasion, when I receive a call and pull out the phone it will be answered. I believe this is due to me or the case bumping a button and it doesn't happen all the time.  
The Helix is cheaper than the Seidio (especially if you get it from ebay like I did) and I think just as good if not better. I'd give it a thumbs up.
