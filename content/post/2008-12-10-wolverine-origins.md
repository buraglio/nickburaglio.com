The new [Wolverine origins](http://www.reelzchannel.com/movie/234326/x-men-origins-wolverine) movie is highly anticipated by pretty much everyone Ive talked to. I’ve been searching the ‘net looking for a decent trailer, even though I know it’s not released it. Well, I found *a* trailer. the quality isn’t the greatest but at least it gets the point across that the movie looks pretty darned awesome.
