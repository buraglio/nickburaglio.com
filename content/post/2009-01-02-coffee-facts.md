It’s a widely known fact that I love *good* coffee. There is something about waking up to the great smell of coffee brewing and then getting a drink of the first cup of the day that is invigorating.   
I like to cook, and I really like to make interesting things and I really, really like to make stuff that tastes good (who doesn’t?), so when I make coffee I try to make the best tasting coffee that I can. Well, thanks to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/), I discovered [Ken](https://twitter.com/weeklyroast) from [Weekly Roast](http://weeklyroast.com/) (actually he added me after I posted about my French Press)

So, when I found that Ken had a [blog](http://weeklyroast.com/blog/) detailing the finer points of brewing a good cup of coffee. He also has a start up business roasting and selling***fresh*** coffee beans.   
Some of the stuff I already knew, similar to making beer, good tasting coffee depends on good tasting ingredients. Use of a water filter is a must, and freshness is a definite factor in drinking good coffee.   
I was already using a french press and have always been pretty adamant about not drinking scorched, old coffee, but some of the things about bean freshness that he posted was pretty surprising to me. Check out his [blog and ](http://weeklyroast.com/blog/)[online shop](http://weeklyroast.com/) for some great info and coffee. I have a bag waiting for me at home that I can’t wait to try!
