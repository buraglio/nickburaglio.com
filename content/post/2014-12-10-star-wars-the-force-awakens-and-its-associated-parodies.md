I am and always have been a huge Star Wars fan. I am old enough to remember ESB and lucky enough to have seen ROTJ in the theater. However, I, like many die hard fans, was completely turned off by EP 1, 2 and 3. So much so that I have erased them from my memory and consider them to never have existed. That is why I wasn’t terribly excited when I heard that there was a [new one being released](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/) (and being directed by [J.J. Abrams](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/?ref_=tt_ov_dr)).![jar-jar-binks](/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/jar-jar-binks.jpg)

And then I saw the trailer.

Wow. Fantastic. I was excited again. I *want* to see this one. Now, that’s not why I’ve made this post. The reason for this post is because not only is there **A NEW STAR WARS MOVIE COMING OUT**, it appears to *not* suck. And there are a TON of great parodies of the trailer. Hysterical trailers. I’ve compiled a few of them here.

Official Trailer:

SNL Parody:

Lego version; also pretty funny:

“George Lucas special Edition” parody; had to be done, he deserves it for making me wait in line for a day to have my experienced ruined by [Jar-Jar Binks](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks):

Even a [spaceballs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094012/) version:

Enjoy, Star Wars Fans, it looks like Boba Fett may have dragged this franchise out of the saarlacc pit.
