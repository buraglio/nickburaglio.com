the first day was beautiful. Weatherwas great, no wind and low humidity. All of the volunteers did a bang up job. One can really teL how much they care about supporting those raising money to help cure MS. Rebecca had a tire blow out in the first 3 miles but got it fixed and finished the 35 with no problem. I did the 75 as did Jeff, Scott, Vic and Jeff's friend. John did the full century, everyone else did the 35. Now we're off for dinner and sleep and do it all again tomorrow.
