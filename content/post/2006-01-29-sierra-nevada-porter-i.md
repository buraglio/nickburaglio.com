### Sierra Nevada Porter 

I saw this and couldn’t resist trying it. I must admit that I didn’t know that the Sierra Nevada Brewery made a porter. I was skeptical but went ahead and paid the $7.99 for a six pack. 5.6 percent alc. per 12oz bottle, it had a thin, light head when first poured. A much more bitter porter than I anticipated, I was a little disapointed to be truthful. It had a strong but quick bitter aftertaste and was not nearly as sweet as any of the other porters I wrote about here. I don’t know that I’d recommend this beer as a “must try” but I wouldn’t go out of my way to get one.
