My old office building located on Neil street in Champaign burned down this morning! It was an old building, built in 1870 I believe, and had a significant amount of issues being that old. It had been undergoing a major renovation since floors two and three had not been used since around 1970 and 1940 or 1950 respectively.   
The employer that I worked for, [Sol Tec, INC.](http://www.soltec.net/) purchased the building around mid-to-late 2001 and sold it a few years later. I left the company in late 2002 but was primarily responsible for getting fiber pulled into the building and relocating all of the Internet Providers services and facilities there around early 2001.
