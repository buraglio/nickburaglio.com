<span>Outside of networking (and even within networking to a certain extent), the buzzword of the day is “The cloud”. All of your data will be in “the cloud”. Think </span>[<span>Skynet</span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator))<span>. </span>[<span>Cloud computing</span>](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing)<span> is how much of our data is handled today. </span>  
<span>What is that, you ask? </span>  
<span>“</span><span>**<span>Cloud computing</span>**</span><span><span> is </span></span><span>[<span>Internet</span>](http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Internet "Internet")</span><span><span>-based </span></span><span>[<span>computing</span>](http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Computing "Computing")</span><span><span>, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to </span></span><span>[<span>computers</span>](http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Computer "Computer")</span><span><span>and other devices on demand, like the </span></span><span>[<span>electricity grid</span>](http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Electricity_grid "Electricity grid")</span><span><span>.” –According to wikipedia. </span></span>  
<span><span>Why is this even remotely interesting? Well, as of now, much of what I do has been moved into “the cloud”. My contacts are stored within google’s massive cloud, as are my emails, calendar, and now this blog text. </span></span>  
<span><span>I have an Android based phone now, even the config that my phone is built from is in the cloud. I’ve moved my photos into </span>[<span>flickr</span>](http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio)<span>. My mail is a Google Apps domain. Why would I do such a thing, you ask? Because it’s REALLY freakin’ convenient. I don’t have to run a server anymore. I don’t need to keep up spamassassin signatures or maintain any postgres or mysql databases. </span></span>  
<span><span>Its also scary. All of my data is not under my control anymore. Once it hits the internet, it’s never possible to know for sure it’s gone should I want it removed. This is a frightening thing when one considers the privacy ramifications. I’ve been slowly moving to this model over the last 5 or 6 years. I was an early beta tester for the google apps and moved my mail around 2005. Other data has been slowly migrating since then. </span></span>

<span>Security is not convenient, and convenient is not often secure. Lets hope our cloud overlords take pity on us when they take over the world. </span>
