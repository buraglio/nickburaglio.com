I decided it was finally time to brew one of my favorite styles for myself. I jumped in with both feet on this one, what I hope to be a VERY hoppy Pale Ale, which I’ve so creatively titled “Buraglio’s Pale Ale”.   
The recipe can be found on Google Documents [here](http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg6p466h_35fr53bwc9).  
Here is an image of it fermenting after 2 days. This was my first batch ever that actually needed a blow off tube rather than a simple airlock.

From the recipe you one can see that I added a lot of not only high IBU hops, but just a lot of hops in general.   
As an aside, I’ve never used whole hop cones before (thanks to Kat Wefel for the hookup of her [home grown Nugget hops](http://buraglio.com/nick/v/Beers/Nugget-Hops.jpg.html)). They’re a little different to deal with, needing to be strained before the move can be made to the primary fermentation vessel.   
I’m still undecided regarding the dry hopping. I may wait for version 2 to give that a try or maybe I’ll get ambitious, only time will tell.
