I had been wanting to see the film “[Beautiful Losers](http://www.beautifullosers.com/)” since I’d heard of it, and I finally had the opportunity to sit down and really enjoy it. This is certainly a movie worth your time if you are interested in real artists, living and working like real artists in todays world.   
I originally wanted to see this because of the heavy influence from the skateboarding world (a world I spent a very good deal of my youth in) but also because I had always aspired to be an artist (and even went and got a degree in arts and technology). I have a great deal of respect for folks like [Mark Gonzalez](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gonzales) and especially [Ed Templeton](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Templeton), for their great artwork and their fierce adherence to being creative and living life on their own terms.

Rent this, it’s worth your time.
