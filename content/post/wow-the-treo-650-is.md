Wow, the treo 650 is a huge step up from the Treo 600. Better Screen, better camera, MUCH better QWERTY keyboard, etc, etc. I've had mine about 24 hours now and damn, I like it a LOT. I am still waiting on my accessories, Plantronics BT headset and cool rubberized case but even w/o them this thing is very nice. A few things to note if upgrading from the 600:  
The connector is different. You'll have to get a new car charger and cradle.  
Bluetooth is crippled on the verizon unit. [Follow these instructions for unlocking it](http://shadowmite.com/wiki/index.php/The_Bluetooth_Dial_Up_Networking_Hack_%28DUN%29)  
buy some stuff from [Treonauts](http://blog.treonauts.com/). This guy provides a nice resource for Treo users.
