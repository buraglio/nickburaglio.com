I’m participating [Hello](https://corpodevolta.com.br/hello-world/) in the ms150 in Illinois this year. For anyone that doesn’t know, [More info can be found here](http://events.msillinois.org/site/PageServer?pagename=05MS150_det_home). My cousin [INETD](http://inetd.org.tr/duyurular/google-yasaklari-hakkinda-inetd-bildirgesi/) has MS, which really sucks. I figure after all the stupid and selfish shit I’ve done over the years maybe I should try give a little back. A few days of riding a bike is a [All](http://www.seemdigitalsolutions.com/3-things-all-sports-uniforms-should-do/) small price to lay for the funds that get raised to help research this.  
Jeff Buraglio [changing](http://www.nickburaglio.com/2005/05/26/ahhhh-the-blog-ever-changing/) has organized an [entire team](http://teamremarkable.org/) of folks riding. I think this is something I may do again next year, I’m kinda getting into this training thing. [wholesale jerseys](http://www.cheapujerseys.com) If you are willing to [donate to sponsor me](https://secure2.convio.net/msil/site/Donation?ACTION=SHOW_DONATION_OPTIONS&CAMPAIGN_ID=1161&PROXY_ID=1189673&FR_ID=1060&JServSessionIdr001=34vgpd9hg1.app1b) please do, it’s for a good cause and is tax deductable.  
I’ll be riding the [new Trek](http://www2.trekbikes.com/Bikes/City_Bike_Path/Hybrid/FX/7300_FX/index.php) that [Rebecca](http://www.buraglio.com/rebecca/) got me for our 5 year anniversary. Rebecca will also be riding this year in this fine event (on her [new Trek](http://www2.trekbikes.com/Bikes/City_Bike_Path/Hybrid/Hybrid/7300/index.php)). We got them [Hello](http://alisa-pogarskaya.ru/hello-world/) both at [champaign cycle](http://www.champaigncycle.com/). I highly recommend them.  
On the same note, I’ve kinda been wanting to get another BMX bike after seeing my friends Mark’s. I almost bought a free agent on ebay the other day……..
