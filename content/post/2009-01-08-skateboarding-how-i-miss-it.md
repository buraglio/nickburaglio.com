Many know that I was, and still am, a huge fan of skateboarding. I started around age 12 (1987), while in Jr. High and continued through college up through probably 4-5 years ago.   
Being from a smaller Midwestern town there is not a lot to do, and not a terribly large amount of outside culture. Magazines are something that we’d read to get updated on the newest tricks, what was new, who rode for what team, etc. There was no internet, and videos were often too expensive for most of us. Being the industrious bunch we were we tried to make our own skate ‘zine (several, actually), without the help of a computer, scanner, digital camera or any experience whatsoever. Well, I had totally forgotten about the very first one, titled “Cold Locals” circa 1988-1989 until I happened across it while looking for something completely different in a box from my parents house that I had never looked in. In there were a bunch of old skate pictures from the late 1980’s up through probably 1991 or 1992. Since I cherish these pictures (yes, the tricks are a little dated as are the clothes) so I thought I’d post a few on here along with scans of the very first (and only) issue of “Cold Locals”.

Cold Locals were:  
Nick Buraglio  
BJ Obermeyer  
Gabe Stith  
for reasons that I don’t remember Ryan Holt wasn’t in this issue but was a major part of our skate crew back then.

Scans of the ‘zine can be found [here](http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio/sets/72157624786252324/with/4918236441/) and below is a slideshow which contains the entire ‘zine as well as some other late 1980’s – early 1990’s skateboarding images of us.
