This van is amazing. I always wanted a "real" van, like an A-Team or Scooby Doo van, but was never really able to make it happen. As of last week, though, we're the owners of a 2011 Toyota Sienna. This 2011 Toyota Sienna is just downright amazing. It drives like a car but has the volume of a full sized van.
