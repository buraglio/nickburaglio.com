I have a few cron jobs that run on my home mac machines and I like to get the notifications generated from the MAILTO parameter. Well, a while ago (I believe after the comcast acquisition of insightbb), this stopped working. I did a little debugging and it is my belief that [port 25 is being blocked outbound from the comcast network](http://www.pdxtc.com/wpblog/technology-articles/cant-send-mail-using-comcast/). [Many people speculate](http://www.google.com/search?q=comcast+blocking+port+25&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a)this, and as a network engineer I think it is actually a good idea. First, port 25 isn't _\***really**\*_ the port that you should be using for host to mail relay. I was always taught that the [submission port](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2476.html) was best practice per [RFC 2476](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2476.html) . In practice, many folks don't use this port simply because since as far back as I can remember documentation has always pointed end users at port 25.  
So, long story short, something I wanted to do for a long time was to set up a special account under my [google apps](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html) that can be used to relay and record this data, as well as be used for things like an email wild card for my domain.  
I was about to embark on hacking up the postfix installs then I came across [this macosxhints article](http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20081217161612647).  
It's a very handy walk through of doing exactly what I wanted to do, relay mail on port 587, over ssl through my ISP to an externally hosted email account.  
Very handy.
