### hofbrau maibock

I'd never had (or heard of) a Maibock before I saw this. Billed as "munich's first maibock", this was a sweet carmel tasting beer, historically enjoyed in the springtime in germany. A decent punch but I'm not sure of the alc. content in this $2.99 pint bottle. I'd not had any food when I enjoyed it and was left with a little buzz. A dark carmel color with very little head, it was a good drink. I'd recommend trying one if presented with the opportunity.
