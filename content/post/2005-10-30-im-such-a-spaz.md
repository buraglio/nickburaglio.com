<div></div>I’m such a spaz. My interests are all over the place. I don’t think that just one blog is enough so therefore I’m playing with the idea of breaking it up into 3 categories. One of my friends, Mike Aref, has just put his [training journal ](http://www.nickburaglio.com/) online and it has given me inspiration to do the same. I think I’ll be breaking up my blog into 3 blog-like sections, training, technical/geeky, and hobbies (like beer, film, games, travel, etc)….I hope this will do a few things, document my technical stuff, record my training and catalog my hobbie stuff. We shall see…..
