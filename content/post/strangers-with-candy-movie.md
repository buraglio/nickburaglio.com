One of the greatesst shows of all times is coming to the bug screen! I've been waiting for this for a LONG time. [Strangers with Candy](http://strangerswithcandymovie.com/), one of the least PC and smartest shows to come out of Comedy Central is coming to theaters this month. I have a feeling that I'll have to wait for it to make it to Champaign, IL but hopefully it'll be worth it. I absolutely loved this show, as did many of my friends, but alas, many did not (or don't) appreciate it's humor much like many of the shows I enjoy\[ed\].  
Anyway, supposedly the "new" show "It's always sunny in Philadelphia" is just as, if not more crass. I've been looking for the first season and just set up a season pass on my tivo for this season. We'll see if it can live up to my expectations.  
  
There is nothing better than comedy that takes no prisoners and pulls no punches.
