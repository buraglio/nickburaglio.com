I made a Belgian ale this weekend, I had most of the ingredients here already, including a good WL Belgian Ale Yeast blend. Itâ€™s currently fermenting away nicely

The recipe can be found [here](http://buraglio.com/nick/brew/recipes/Buraglio_s_Belgian_Ale.html) or [here](http://docs.google.com/a/buraglio.com/Doc?id=dg6p466h_32dgpbp4f6) for the google document version (it will update as I add notes).
