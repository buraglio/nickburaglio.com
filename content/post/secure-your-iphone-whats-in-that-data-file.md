The Contents of the /var/root/Library/Keyboard file on an iPhone contains all non-default dictionary words. Not likely a problem, but it's a good idea to know if personal or private information is being stored on a mobile device. Since I'm doing a lot more security stuff now in my new position, I have been trying to apply some of the things I like (such as apple and mobile hardware) to the position. I believe it to be very important to know how/when/why potentially personal or private information is stored. This is likely not an issue for most people but the more info we have the better.
