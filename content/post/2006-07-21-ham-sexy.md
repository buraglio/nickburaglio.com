Well, I am officially a “nerd” according to most of my friends. I set a goal for myself to get my HAM radio license, for a few reasons. The first being that I am goinf to be in Tampa, FL at the tail end of hurricane season adn want a way to contact people not via net or phone if need be. The second being that I have a severe lack of electronics knowledge and thought this would be a good way to get introduced. I sat for the Tech ticket last Sunday and passed it and was issued [KC9JVU](http://www.qrz.com/detail/KC9JVU) as my callsign as of yesterday. I applied for a vanity callsign today so we’ll see how long that takes. I have been playing with [ echomac ](http://www.dogparksoftware.com/EchoMac.html)and the [IRLP](http://www.irlp.net/) stuff, it’s pretty slick; right up my alley with the VoIP stuff. Now I can legally have a scanner in my car, too. Now to re-learn morse code……
