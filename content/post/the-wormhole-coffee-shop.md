The video of [The Wormhole Coffee Shop](http://www.thewormholecoffee.com/_/Welcome.html) was sent to my by my younger brother today. This place looks to be so full of awesome; I had to watch this video twice. It's like my childhood and my adulthood had a baby and that baby was an amazingly cool coffee shop! What is not to like about [Doc Brown's DeLorean Time Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine)!?!  
  
  
  
I've never been there, but as soon as I get back up the Chicago area, I'll be making a special trip to get some coffee at this place.  Any place that has a coffee [drink named after a Ghostbusters character](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76Lr1nBXCNg&feature=player_embedded) has to be pretty cool.
