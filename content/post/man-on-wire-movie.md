This Movie / Documentary looks very cool. IT should be playing at [Boardman's](http://www.boardmansarttheatre.com/) soon. This guy is crazy, but it kinda makes sense.  
  
  
  
It's getting great reviews:  
  
_"I am afraid of heights. Now you know. That is one reason I was helplessly engrossed in "Man on Wire," the story of how Philippe Petit crossed eight times on a tight-wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center on Aug. 7, 1974. Another reason is that the documentary, a hybrid of actual and restaged footage, is constructed like a first-rate thriller."- Roger Ebert \* \* \* \*_  
  
  
_"James Marsh's brilliant documentary on a Frenchman's 1974 high-wire walk between the twin towers has the pace of a thriller and the human interest of a psychological drama."- LA Times_
