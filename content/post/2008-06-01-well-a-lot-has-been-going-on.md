A lot has been going on. I’ve been to Aruba on vacation and to Canada for a [great conference](http://www.bsdcan.org/). Summer is here and I’m gearing up for the [MS150](https://msillinois.org/)…..It looks like we’re sticking around Champaign for a while longer, but life’s about to get a little more interesting……..

Thats right, I’ve gone and procreated.
