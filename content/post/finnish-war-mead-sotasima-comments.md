what ratio did you use to replace the refined sugar with honey? Also, did you just replace the white sugar with honey or did you also replace the brown sugar as well?

I have never used refined sugar so I have no real ratio, I generally use a gallon of honey for ~4 gallons of water and adjust accordingly based on how much I want to produce. On occasion I'll add other types of honey in smaller amounts in addition to alter flavor.
