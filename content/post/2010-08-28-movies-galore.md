I’m a huge fan of movies and film. I have a minor in film studies from Illinois State University and did (sometimes still do) a bit of video art. I’ve embraced the technology at this point and use Netflix quite a bit and watch movies as I get time.

I have a fairly extensive DVD (and now Blue Ray) collection as well.   
Here you can find the top few movies off of my Netflix queue.

There are going to be some kids movies on there now as well =)
