- Yawn. Hotel coffee really sucks when you‚Äôre used to @[weeklyroast](http://twitter.com/weeklyroast) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13848496867)
- Really impressed with the Arkansas University and ARE-ON folks at this @[internet2](http://twitter.com/internet2) #[IPv6](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23IPv6) workshop. Great job guys, well done! [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13891189836)
- Really, really enjoyed being an instructor for the @[internet2](http://twitter.com/internet2) #[IPv6](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23IPv6) class down here in beautiful Fayetteville, Arkansas. #[fb](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23fb) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13891487714)
- @[cvkline](http://twitter.com/cvkline) A-MAZ-ING. Went 2 nights in a row, possibly best beers I‚Äôve experienced at a brewpub, ever. Great food as well. Seriously good. [in reply to cvkline](http://twitter.com/cvkline/statuses/13891590242) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13891836994)
- @[cvkline](http://twitter.com/cvkline) Very good Imp IPA, belgian trip, coffee porter‚Ä¶.the list goes on. Very diverse offering and all were not good, but \*great\*. [in reply to cvkline](http://twitter.com/cvkline/statuses/13891590242) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13891936935)
- @[cvkline](http://twitter.com/cvkline) and the brewmaster is only like 29 years old. Very impressive. <http://www.hoghaus.com/> [in reply to cvkline](http://twitter.com/cvkline/statuses/13891590242) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13892028442)
- Homeward bound. [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13908528256)
- Imagine that. Delays at o‚Äôhare airport. Very inconvient. [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13911222700)
- With all of the storms down here I wish I would have brought a HAM radio to listen to the chatter. Many tornados in AR. [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13911529063)
- Finally departing XNA for IND via ORD (odd path, I know). [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13915670561)

- I leave for 4 days and my neighbor constructs a fence, connects it to mine w/o asking and likely without measuring property lines [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13934228316)
- @[tsrimovsky](http://twitter.com/tsrimovsky) Both. Seriously, who does that without at least asking? Very uncool. I‚Äôm going to request it be removed for real. [in reply to tsrimovsky](http://twitter.com/tsrimovsky/statuses/13935982970) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/13938130699)
- @[RadishSpirit](http://twitter.com/RadishSpirit) coffee, then pizza, then coffee again. [in reply to RadishSpirit](http://twitter.com/RadishSpirit/statuses/14037370474) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/14042548496)
- @[RadishSpirit](http://twitter.com/RadishSpirit) well done. I am still working on coffee part deux. [in reply to RadishSpirit](http://twitter.com/RadishSpirit/statuses/14042699799) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/14046343006)
- @[liquidrider148](http://twitter.com/liquidrider148) I need to make one as well. Thinking about a @[weeklyroast](http://twitter.com/weeklyroast) subscription. [in reply to liquidrider148](http://twitter.com/liquidrider148/statuses/14046128261) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/14046377924)
- @[Vap0rz](http://twitter.com/Vap0rz) it can be done for \*much\* cheaper than that. [in reply to Vap0rz](http://twitter.com/Vap0rz/statuses/14054857548) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/14056152874)
- @[Vap0rz](http://twitter.com/Vap0rz) you can get it done elsewhere for much cheaper but rolex will always cost more. [in reply to Vap0rz](http://twitter.com/Vap0rz/statuses/14056919544) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/14057491377)
- @[Vap0rz](http://twitter.com/Vap0rz) what the heck happened to it? It should be sapphire and nearly indestructible [in reply to Vap0rz](http://twitter.com/Vap0rz/statuses/14056919544) [\#](http://twitter.com/buraglio/statuses/14057526708)
