This Movie / Documentary looks very cool. IT should be playing at [Boardman’s](http://www.boardmansarttheatre.com/) soon. This guy is crazy, but it kinda makes sense.

It’s getting great reviews:

*“I am afraid of heights. Now you know. That is one reason I was helplessly engrossed in “Man on Wire,” the story of how Philippe Petit crossed eight times on a tight-wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center on Aug. 7, 1974. Another reason is that the documentary, a hybrid of actual and restaged footage, is constructed like a first-rate thriller.”- Roger Ebert \* \* \* \**

*“James Marsh’s brilliant documentary on a Frenchman’s 1974 high-wire walk between the twin towers has the pace of a thriller and the human interest of a psychological drama.”- LA Times*
