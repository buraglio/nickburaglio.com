I decided to move to a content management system that I have a little more control over. As of tonight, I have migrated to a Movable Type setup. All the previous articles have been archived at <http://buraglio.com/archive/>  
I hope to get them imported into MT but have yet to be successful in doing so. Hopefully this will make for more frequent updates since I can update it more easily from my Treo 650.
