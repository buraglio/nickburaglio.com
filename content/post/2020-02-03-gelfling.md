Re-learning skills from 20+ years prior is no easy task, especially when working in a medium that was not your comfort zone. For me it is a slow process, but it is enjoyable and relaxing. I spent a little more time playing around with photoshop and Procreate have yielded this Dark crystal homage and a Boba Fett & IG-88 Campaign poster.

I want to be able to make designs that can more easily be printed on things such as stickers, shirts, etc. This seemed like a reasonable path to start with. Simple lines, really basic shading, etc.

Fett/IG 2020 was based on a[ photo of my original toy](https://nickburaglio.com/2013/08/24/boba-fett-1981/)s.
