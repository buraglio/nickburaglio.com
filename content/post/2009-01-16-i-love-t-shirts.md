Anyone that knows me knows that I love T-Shirts. They’ve been pretty much the only thing I have worn for the bulk of my life, much to my mother and wife’s dismay. That said, there are a lot of shirt ideas that I’ve had in the past but I’ve never had any mechanism for making them. Often it’s not economical for local print shops to make just 1 or 2 shirts from a design, so a consumer needs to order them in bulk, making it not economical for the consumer. Enter the internet. There are ***so*** many ways to get this done now, from [Custom Ink.com](http://www.customink.com/), to [Zazzle](http://www.zazzle.com/) and[ Cafe Press](http://www.cafepress.com/) to [Spreadshirt](http://www.spreadshirt.com/) there are a myriad of ways to get a shirt made.   
I opted to put most of my stuff on [Spreadshirt](http://buraglio.spreadshirt.com/) so that anyone can buy a shirt that I thought was cool enough to make. I’ve added a link to the[ “shop”](http://buraglio.com/nick/shop) at the top of the page for anyone that wants to look.   
This brings me to my newest shirt, the “[Mac](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0568390/) from [It’s always Sunny in Philadelphia](http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/sunny/) [RIOT shirt](http://buraglio.spreadshirt.com/us/US/Shop/Article/Index/article/4060519/)“.   
I didn’t find an “official” one so I decided to make one. It also has a small barcode of “RIOT” on the bottom of the back of the shirt, just for an added touch. There were a few others out there but I preferfed a different font (even if it wasn’t exact).
