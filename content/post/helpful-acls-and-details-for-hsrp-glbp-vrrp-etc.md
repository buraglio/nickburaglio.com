Always being on the lookout for good, well put together information, I came across [this network oriented technical blog](http://aconaway.com/2008/06/12/acls-and-hsrp-bgp-ospf-vrrp-glbp), and it was a pretty helpful find, containing many of the ACLs and details for HSRP, BGP, OSPF, VRRP, GLBP. I posted a comment containing VRRP-E information.  
Anyone that has to deal with these protocols will likely find this a decent reference, and since they're all things that network engineers use all the time, it's nice to have them all in one place.  
I would suggest adding his [RSS Feed](http://aconaway.com/feed/) to whatever your favorite RSS reader is. There is a lot of good information there and (unlike myself) the author seems pretty diligent about keeping it updated with _useful_ information.
