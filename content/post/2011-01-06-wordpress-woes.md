I’m extremely irritated by the one last blog that I host on wordpress that I just can’t seem to get converted to <span>any<span></span></span> other format.   
WordPress, while a very nice publishing platform, isn’t quite compliant with the XML standard in the way that they format their export files. So, what that means for anyone that has a decent sized blog that they want to move to anything other than wordpress, is that they may be out of luck. Google has a pretty robust set of [blog conversion tools](http://code.google.com/p/google-blog-converters-appengine/), which worked for me for all of my sites, personal and business……except for one. As stated [here](http://code.google.com/p/google-blog-converters-appengine/issues/detail?id=45), wordpress2blogger gives me “not valid XML” error when trying to convert. I’ve cleaned this file as best I can by hand, but it’s enormous and I’m still missing pieces. It’s irritating and at this point I’m almost ready to keep this one as a one-off and install mysql, wordpress, etc., etc., etc…….

Thanks wordpress.
