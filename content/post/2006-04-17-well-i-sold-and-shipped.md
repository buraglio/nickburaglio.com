<div></div>Well, I sold and shipped the last of my neo-classic star wars toys today. I’m a little sad about it but at 31 years old I don’t think I’ll be playing with them. With the money I bought a new 2005 [Bianchi Velochi](http://bianchiusa.com/05_veloce.html) from bikeworks in Urbana, IL. I got a sweet deal on it and it is one hell of a bike. He’s building it right now and I should have it this week. I rode a few other bikes, a Trek and a Lemond (AL frame bikes) but none were as smooth as the Bianchi’s I rode. The creamy shifting and light, quick but smooth ride was something I couldn’t stop thinking about as I rode the others. It’d not a daily rider, mind you. That seat is reserved for my Trek 7300FX, but it’ll be a sweet training and race bike!
