A major TV network hit me with a nastygram telling me that my T-Shirt that I had made, and never sold or even bought for myself, was infringing on their copyright and trademark of a certain high school character played by [Mark-Paul Gosselaar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-Paul_Gosselaar) that carried a giant phone. I dare not even mutter the name, which was in the title of the shirt, for fear that the media giant come and take away my will to live.

OK, I was probably naive in using the name. I profusely apologized and left the unsold product off the market.

The kicker, however, was that they claimed that the image, that was a picture of me (who looks NOTHING like [Mark-Paul Gosselaar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-Paul_Gosselaar)), was "evocative" of their copyright and trademark.

Wow, that is a stretch. A big stretch. Here is the text that I received:

  

_"We own the rights to the character "\[name I dare not mention out loud\]" and the design is still nonetheless evocative of our copyright and trademark. You have been put on notice. Thank you for your prompt compliance."_

  

For reference, here is the image, wholy created and owned by me (and also a picture OF me).
