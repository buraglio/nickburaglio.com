I saw this over at my little brother's blog, it looks pretty amazing. I'm a pretty big fan of post-apocalyptic AND Zombie stuff, this one looks like it delivers. I'm not familiar with the graphic novel, but if Mike says it's good, it probably is. I'm going to order it and check it out before the premiere of the show. AMC has been really pumping out some good stuff lately, lets hope this lives up to its trailer.
