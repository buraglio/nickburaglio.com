With the impending release of the iPhone firmware 1.1.3 there are a lot of additions, most important to me being the inclusion of multi recipient SMS messages (something that should have been there from day one). [cre.ations.net](http://cre.ations.net/blog/post/iphone-113-home-screen-rearrangement-video) has a video of one of the other cool features, movable icons (something available with a jailbroken iPhone for a long time). Anyway, it’s nice to see apple actually including it. I’m still waiting to see the \*actual\* release date, it’ll probably be around Macworld, but who knows. …now all they need is MMS to be compliant with phones from 2003. ![](http://cre.ations.net/image/view/640/2395)
