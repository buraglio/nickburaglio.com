What is it about today? So many posts! (I had some free time). It’s a widely known fact that I love T-Shirts. I have a fairly extensive collections that contains shirts that I’ve had for half of my life (yeah, I have 15 year old T-Shirts, what of it?!?) I have always wanted to start a T-Shirt company, not for profit so much as for fun. This may become a reality, but thats a story for another time. I was looking for something fun and found 3 pretty good places online to get shirts. [BustedTees.com](http://www.bustedtees.com/) has some awesome shirts, I particularly like the “Jesus” shirt (referenced from [The Big Lebowski](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/), which is a must own IMO). [ Brew City Online](http://www.brewcityonline.com/) has some great beer related shirts, I recommend picking one up. But the mother load of them all HAS to be [ Found Item Clothing](http://www.founditemclothing.com/). This guy has followed every detail on some CLASSIC shirts. I have ordered a few from him and he always ships promptly and the product is exactly as described. I strive to have all the ones he makes, since they are all classics in my book.
