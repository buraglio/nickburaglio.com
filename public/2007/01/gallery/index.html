			<p>I finally got my photos moved over to a <a href="http://www.buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/">Gallery Install</a> and stored in a nice postgres database&hellip;. iPhoto is the bomb, there are so many plugins that make it useful. <a href="http://zwily.com/iphoto/">iphoto2gallery</a> is a marvelous tool. Kudos to the author, it&rsquo;s very useful. There are also shutterfly exports, picasaweb export plugins, the list goes on and on. I guess I&rsquo;m just spoiled by the fact that I never have to use a windows box.<br />
I figured I&rsquo;d use the fact that Rebecca got me a Canon EOS Rebel XTI for xmas as a driving factor&hellip;(and WOW does it take nice images!), not to mention the fact that we&rsquo;ve got a new friend in the house.</p>
