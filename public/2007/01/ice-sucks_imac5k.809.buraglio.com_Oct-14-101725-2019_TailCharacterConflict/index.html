			<p>Check out how slick this road is! Crazy. It looks like a game of bumper cars and seems to go on forever:</p>

<p>Speaking of crummy weather, my less-than-a-year-old subaru had a branch fall on it this weekend and literally shatter out the hatchback window due to high winds. Very uncool, very inconvenient. It had to be a freak thing, the place it hit was right above the body, which basically took out the entire back window. Not fun. At least there was very minimal body damage.</p>
