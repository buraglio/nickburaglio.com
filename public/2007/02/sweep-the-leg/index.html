			<p>This was brought to my attention by my cousin, Tony, and is probably one of the greatest things I&rsquo;ve seen in a looooooooong time. I believe it has pretty much all the original characters from <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0087538/">The Karate Kid</a>. I had to watch it twice in a row.<br />
Enjoy:</p>
