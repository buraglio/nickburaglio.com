			<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve decided that I think I&rsquo;m going to wait and not get an iPhone. As much of an Apple zealot as I am, this may seem like a strange choice. Well, with a lot of the details surfacing with it&rsquo;s impending release, I think it&rsquo;s just too early. While I believe Apple is a very good company and makes quality hardware and software, I think that this is far too new of a market for them. The lack of a[n easily] user replaceable battery and a brand new touchscreen technology is just too many new variables. I was always taught to never buy into a first release of something that is very important, let someone else work out the bugs.<br />
Instead, I&rsquo;ve decided to still switch to AT&amp;T (from Verizon, whom I&rsquo;ve had for years) to make it easier to change devices and to get rollover and to go with the Treo 680.</p>

<p>My reasonings are founded based on primarily rumor, since the iPhone is not yet available. Check out the rumor postings <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/reader">here</a>.</p>
