			<p>Anyone that knows me knows that I love T-Shirts. They&rsquo;ve been pretty much the only thing I have worn for the bulk of my life, much to my mother and wife&rsquo;s dismay. That said, there are a lot of shirt ideas that I&rsquo;ve had in the past but I&rsquo;ve never had any mechanism for making them. Often it&rsquo;s not economical for local print shops to make just 1 or 2 shirts from a design, so a consumer needs to order them in bulk, making it not economical for the consumer. Enter the internet. There are <strong><em>so</em></strong> many ways to get this done now, from <a href="http://www.customink.com/">Custom Ink.com</a>, to <a href="http://www.zazzle.com/">Zazzle</a> and <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/">Cafe Press</a> to <a href="http://www.spreadshirt.com/">Spreadshirt</a> there are a myriad of ways to get a shirt made.<br />
I opted to put most of my stuff on <a href="http://buraglio.spreadshirt.com/">Spreadshirt</a> so that anyone can buy a shirt that I thought was cool enough to make. I&rsquo;ve added a link to the <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/shop">&ldquo;shop&rdquo;</a> at the top of the page for anyone that wants to look.<br />
This brings me to my newest shirt, the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0568390/">Mac</a> from <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/sunny/">It&rsquo;s always Sunny in Philadelphia</a> <a href="http://buraglio.spreadshirt.com/us/US/Shop/Article/Index/article/4060519/">RIOT shirt</a>&rdquo;.<br />
I didn&rsquo;t find an &ldquo;official&rdquo; one so I decided to make one. It also has a small barcode of &ldquo;RIOT&rdquo; on the bottom of the back of the shirt, just for an added touch. There were a few others out there but I preferfed a different font (even if it wasn&rsquo;t exact).</p>
