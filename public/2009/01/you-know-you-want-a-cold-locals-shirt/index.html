			<p>Image manipulation via either <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop/compare/">Photoshop</a>, <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a>, or whatever is a wonderful tool and can provide hours of entertainment. In keeping with the skateboarding theme of the last few days, I decided to mess a little with some of the images and came up with this:</p>

<p><a href="http://image.spreadshirt.com/image-server/image/composition/4309699/view/1/producttypecolor/1/type/png/width/280/height/280/cold-locals-tee_design.png"><img src="http://image.spreadshirt.com/image-server/image/composition/4309699/view/1/producttypecolor/1/type/png/width/280/height/280/cold-locals-tee_design.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>So retro! So old school! Wow, it&rsquo;s a xeroxed image!</p>

<p>Reminiscent of the old do-it-yourself style that was so common in early skateboarding, I just had to have this image from the archives on a some sort of apparel.<br />
Through the magic and wonder that is the internet, I had nearly instant gratification. A <a href="http://tinyurl.com/87fo5d">Short Sleeved T- Shirt</a>, a <a href="http://tinyurl.com/a9cwbu">long sleeved T-Shirt</a>, and even the always stylish <a href="http://tinyurl.com/8gn979">hooded sweatshirt</a>. Now you can show your colors if you were a Clinton or Wapella, Illinois skateboarder from the early days.</p>
