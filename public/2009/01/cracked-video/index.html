			<p>A <a href="http://buraglio.com/luke/2009/01/03/first-night-and-first-full-day-integtration-into-the-family/">recent post</a> about integrating our <a href="http://buraglio.com/luke">new son</a> into our family of four legged kids led me to a goldmine that I never knew existed. <a href="http://vwelch.com/">Von Welch</a> sent me a funny video from <a href="http://www.cracked.com/">Cracked.com</a>. I had no idea that they had video, and most of it is pretty darned funny. Anyway, Von sent me <a href="http://www.cracked.com/video_16892_worst-parents-ever.html">this video</a>, which I thoroughly enjoyed.</p>

<p>There is a wealth of other funny stuff, like <a href="http://www.cracked.com/video_16862_5-things-you-shouldnt-be-able-buy-on-ebay.html">this video</a> about 5 things that you shouldn&rsquo;t be able to buy on ebay:</p>

<p>I have a feeling that this site is going to be a time vortex for me. Thanks Von.</p>
