			<p>Finally, finally, finally. The iPhone 3.0 OS that was <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/03/17/iphone-os-30-screenshot-walkthrough/">announced this week</a> is <strong>finally</strong> adding features that the original iPhone should have had. Features that some of which, other than a software addition, were always possible, not new, but nonetheless unavailable.<br />
The features include:<br />
Exchange 2007 remote search support<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service">MMS</a><br />
Copy/Paste<br />
Read and compose email and text messages in landscape<br />
&hellip;among many others.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve finally stepped out to 2004 with the addition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service">MMS</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_Messaging_Service">MMS</a> is a luxury, I agree, but i used to use the heck out of it and the fact that it wasn&rsquo;t available on such an elegant device such as the iPhone was, frankly, stupid. The argument that we should &ldquo;email photos&rdquo; holds no water since (being very generous) only 20% of people have smartphones that can get email.<br />
Copy/Paste is also not new, but was something that I could understand not being in the first rev of the iPhone. The touchscreen implementation was completely new and I&rsquo;m sure it was hard to get that aspect just right. A little late, but Kudos, apple.<br />
Exchange 2007 remote search support&hellip;.ehh, I don&rsquo;t really care that much but I may care more if I have to switch to exchange for work email. Lets just hope we can have more than one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActiveSync">ActiveSync</a> account since now <a href="http://www.google.com/mobile/apple/">google offers a push calendar solution</a> that I&rsquo;m pretty much fully invested in.</p>

<p>This looks pretty slick. I can&rsquo;t wait.</p>
