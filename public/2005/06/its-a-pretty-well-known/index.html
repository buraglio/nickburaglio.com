			<p>It&rsquo;s a pretty well known fact that I like Apple computers and most people have seen a lot of the spam and ads referring to getting a free mac mini or a free ipod. I always thought they were BS. A scam attempt to harvest email addresses or another version of something nasty.<br />
Well, interestingly enough, I actually know someone who really DID get the free Mac Mini, I saw it. He already had one, and sold the one he got for free for ~$500 and bought an ipod photo. I was flabbergasted. I couldn&rsquo;t believe that it actually worked. There had to be a catch, and in fact, there was.<br />
I decided that I was going to read up on it, after all, there are tons of people selling this info on ebay, posting it on web forums, etc. Maybe I&rsquo;d a actually give it a try. What the hell, right? After doing a little reading it looked to me like it was some kind of a pyramid scheme. I signed up at <a href="http://www.freeminimacs.com/">FreeMiniMacs.com</a> with a <a href="http://www.gmail.com/">GMail</a> account I use for stuff like this and had at it.<br />
You have to complete an &ldquo;offers&rdquo; meaning that you have to sign up for something. THEN, you need to refer (I believe) 10 people to do the same. For what it&rsquo;s worth, my link is <a href="http://www.freeminimacs.com/?r=14799159">here</a>.<br />
We&rsquo;ll see how long this takes&hellip;..if it ever completes.</p>
