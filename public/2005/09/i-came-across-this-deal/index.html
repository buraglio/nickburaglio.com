			<p>I came across this deal at <a href="http://slickdeals.net/">slickdeals.net</a>. <a href="http://smallbusiness.yahoo.com/domains/?p=CRUISE">Yahoo has domain purchases for $1.99 per year</a>. Normally I use <a href="http://godaddy.com/">godaddy</a> but this was too good of a deal to pass up. I picked up nickburaglio.com again (I had let it lapse back in like 2000) for a couple of years for under $4.00 and moved the blog over to it. Not too bad of a deal for a self indulgent domain such as this.<br />
On a less entertaining note, I noticed that all my i386 boxes that I own (which are old to begin with) are pretty much dead except one. It sucks since I&rsquo;d really like to have a nice machine to run freebsd on. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to run it on one of my macs and miss out on OS X.</p>
