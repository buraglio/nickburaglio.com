			<p>The breakup of the blog really didn&rsquo;t work. I have been so busy with work that I didn&rsquo;t post at all. I had been traveling a lot lately, Seattle, Mexico, back to Seattle. All in all I was gone about a month. Seattle is probably the coolest US city I&rsquo;ve been to, not as rain-soaked as many say. Both times I was there (a 4 day trip and an 11 day trip) for work it drizzled a bit but for the most part it was pretty nice. I would love to go again, it seems like the Pacific Northwest is somewhere I could stay for a while. Supercomputing was great as always, awesome food, cool projects, fun times. We did have time to hit the REI store, several of us climbed the pinnacle (which I had never done before).<br />

I did the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">NCSA</a> booth this year as well as worked with <a href="http://scinet.supercomp.org/">SCinet</a> on various things. I had the best seafood that I&rsquo;ve ever had in my life, if you are a fan of seafood I HIGHLY recommend taking a trip to the Washington coast area. <a href="http://buraglio.com/pics/ncsa/SuperComputing05/">Some pics from the trip.</a></p>

<p>Something else announced, <a href="http://www.force10networks.com/">Force10 networks</a>has acquired a pretty cool little company; <a href="http://www.metanetworks.org/">Meta Networks</a>. For those that don&rsquo;t know, Meta Networks makes a very cool IDS card that can do 10gig with minimal overhead to the host OS. At <a href="http://www.sc05.org/">SC|05</a> they announced the purchase and gave a little talk regarding the product. Livio Ricciulli, the founder of Meta Networks was there to help with the product, which was used by <a href="http://scinet.supercomp.org/">SCinet</a> to help secure the very high performance network. VERY cool stuff indeed. I like the idea of the programmable card (that can do a LOT of cool stuff) a little more than the way that <a href="http://www.endace.com/">Endace</a> cards operate, although the endace 10gig cards are very nice as well.</p>
