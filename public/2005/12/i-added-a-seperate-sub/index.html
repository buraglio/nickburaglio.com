			<p>I added a seperate sub category (that I hope to recruit some people to work on with me); beer reviews. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to do beer write-ups but have never really been a &ldquo;beer expert&rdquo; or a &ldquo;beer snob&rdquo; so I thought that I probably shouldn&rsquo;t do it. Then I got to thinking, maybe thats why I *should* do it. I always hated reading pretentious beer drinkers account of some beer they had after playing a polo match or before getting into their limo to be whisked away to their private jet and flown to switzerland to count their money. I like beer. Sometimes I get good beer, sometimes not. Either way I hope to write about it in this <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/beer/">Beer review</a>. Maybe some people will add to it.</p>
