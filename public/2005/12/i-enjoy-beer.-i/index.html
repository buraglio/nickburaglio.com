<p>I enjoy beer. I don&rsquo;t drink as much of it as I used to, but on occasion I like to down a few good ones (I&rsquo;ll also down a few bad ones if that is all there is). I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a &ldquo;Beer Snob&rdquo; as I&rsquo;ve been known to drink anything from PBR, Natural Lite and Stag to a $12 imported porter. I&rsquo;m not normally a big fan of the lighter stuff but I came across this ale, Smithwick&rsquo;s. It&rsquo;s just the right blend if what I like. A little bite but smooth at the end. From <a href="http://www.realbeer.com/">Realbeer.com</a>:<br />
&ldquo;Made by Guinness in Ireland, Smithwick&rsquo;s is inspired by John Smithwick&rsquo;s original recipe, which was first brewed at St. Francis Abbey in Kilkenny, Ireland. St. Francis Abbey has been in operation since 1710, making it one of Ireland&rsquo;s oldest breweries.&rdquo;<br />
I&rsquo;d recommend trying this if you can find it (which has been my problem as of late). It&rsquo;s smooth enough that a casual light beer drinker would probably enjoy it but flavorful enough that even a beer snob probably wouldn&rsquo;t snicker. I&rsquo;d really like to find some more of it, I had a 6 pack given to me and I just finished off the last one. I&rsquo;ve tried looking online as well as every local place in Champaign-Urbana, Bloomington and other surrounding Central Illinois towns with no success. I hear tale that it&rsquo;s found primarily in larger cities, St. Louis, Chicago, etc., but last time I looked in STL it I couldn&rsquo;t find it there either (granted I didn&rsquo;t look that hard). If anyone knows somewhere in Central IL (or online) that I can order this please let me know. I&rsquo;d love to get my hands on some more.</p>
