My back is feeling better and I&rsquo;ve resumes training for my sprint triathlon. I have not yet really started back at boxing, jiu jitsu or wrestling but hopefully this thursday I&rsquo;ll be rolling with some friends from home. Speaking of home, the <a href="http://www.clintondailyjournal.com/">Clinton Daily Journal</a> ran a story on us doing the ms150 bike tour. It didn&rsquo;t have the whole story online so I made a quick scan (above).</p>
