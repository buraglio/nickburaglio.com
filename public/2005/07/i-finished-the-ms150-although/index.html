			<p>I finished the ms150, although not the way I had originally intended. The first day was 75 miles. Not too bad. We set off at about 6am, it was relatively pleasant outside. There was a rest stop for water, energy bars, fruit and bathrooms about every 8-13 miles (basically in every small town we went though). These were amazing. Some even had cooked food like egg sandwiches, etc I stocked up at pretty much every one, got water and a snack. John Holland and I drank some generic pedialite before the trfip or hydration (this is awesome stuff, it&rsquo;ll pretty much cure a hangover). About 10am it started getting hot and humid. I learned some good things about cycling that day.<br />
1. Always wear a jersey. I wore a team T-shirt and it didn&rsquo;t breathe&hellip;.at all. once it was sweaty, it was pretty much like a wet towel on my back.<br />
2. Always wear good padded bike shorts. I bought some nice ones right before the trip. They singlehandedly saved my taint.<br />
3. clipless petals. necessity. I had no clips or clipless shoes, just normal petals. I came back and bought some clip petals, which leads me to my next point.<br />
4. At LEAST use road bike tires. My trek 7300 is pretty light but the tires are hybrid tires. Road bike tires roll longer and are lighter. I&rsquo;m trying to scrapte up enough money to get either a trek 1200 or (more likely) a trek 1000 for longer rides. I&rsquo;ve also been looking at several Bianchi models.<br />
We finished the first day about 1pm, ate, drank some more pedialite and went to bed. My right knee was a little sore when I woke up at 4:30am on Sunday and I had the start of a cold. I had been fighting it off the previous week and I thought I&rsquo;d beat it but the exertion must have lowered my immune system enough for it to come back. I took some zycam and pedialite and we set out for day 2. Suprisingly, other than some soreness in my right knee my legs were fine.<br />
Day 2 was MUCH more of a mild day. We got about 10 miles in and I though &ldquo;I have to work tomorrow&rdquo; and opted for the 35 mile route. My cousin jeff, his dad Vic, John Holland and my uncle Scott all opted for the 75 mile route. I really with I would have done it but I fear that if I had I would not have been able to work on Monday.<br />
I was somewhat disapointed with myself so I pushed as hard as I could for the rest of the 35 miles and finished (after a 15 minute stop at the last rest area for some phone calls) at about 9:30 at which point I went to my car and went to sleep for a while. The rest of the 35 mile crew came in at about 1 with the 75 milers not too far after.<br />
I&rsquo;m going to be more prepared next year (wherever it is) and am planning a 65 mile ride in August as well as some rides to Clinton from Savoy before the season ends. More detailed account can be found at <a href="http://www.teamremarkable.com/">here</a></p>
