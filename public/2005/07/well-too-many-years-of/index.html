			<p>Well, too many years of skateboarding have taken their toll on my 30 year old body. An old injury from ~10 years ago has once again reared it&rsquo;s ugly head. After doing my normal <a href="http://www.jackmcvicker.com/academy.html">Saturday morning workout</a> and doing one 5 minute round my back started to tighten up. By the time I had gotten home I could barely get out of the car. So much for training hard for the <a href="http://www.champaignparkdistrict.com/sports/minitri/">mini triathlon</a> that I&rsquo;m (hopefully still) doing. Now that I can&rsquo;t get off the chair I&rsquo;ve been really scouring the net for other little activities I can do. If I can get back to training soon I think I may also try to do the <a href="http://www.bikeandhikeweb.com/text/events.htm">duathlon in Charleston, IL</a>. Who knows, I hope to feel better in a few days.<br />
I&rsquo;ve also been looking at getting a road bike. Champaign Cycles has some REALLY good deals on both the <a href="http://www.trekbikes.com/bikes/2004/road/1200.jsp">Trek 1200</a> and <a href="http://www.trekbikes.com/bikes/2004/road/1000.jsp">Trek 1000</a>. They also have a good price on a Lemond that is my size.</p>
