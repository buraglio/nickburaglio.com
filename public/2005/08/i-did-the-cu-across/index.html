			<p>I did the <a href="http://prairiecycleclub.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=Sections&amp;file=index&amp;req=viewarticle&amp;artid=5&amp;page=1">CU across the prairie</a> metric century ride this weekend. We started at about 0845 and got finished around 1330, not a bad time for someone as inexperienced as myself I think. We did stop at 2 rest stops along the way for water. It was pretty fun, I never realized that Monticello, IL had so many nice houses out in the country around there. The head winds sucked toward the end and we had gotten started a little late, so heat was a small factor too. I got pretty sunburned on my arms but I did learn some good technique from Mark, who is an experienced cyclist. It&rsquo;s a fun ride, I&rsquo;ll be doing it again next year I hope, but I do plan to get a road bike for any trip longer than 20 miles. The Trek 7300FX is a great bike, especially now with the thin road bike tires, perfect for riding to work every day, but I think I&rsquo;d prefer a more aerodynamic bike for longer rides.</p>
