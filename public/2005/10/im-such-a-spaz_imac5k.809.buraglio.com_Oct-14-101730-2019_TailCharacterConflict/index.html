			<p>I&rsquo;m such a spaz. My interests are all over the place. I don&rsquo;t think that just one blog is enough so therefore I&rsquo;m playing with the idea of breaking it up into 3 categories. One of my friends, Mike Aref, has just put his <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/">training journal</a> online and it has given me inspiration to do the same. I think I&rsquo;ll be breaking up my blog into 3 blog-like sections, training, technical/geeky, and hobbies (like beer, film, games, travel, etc)&hellip;.I hope this will do a few things, document my technical stuff, record my training and catalog my hobbie stuff. We shall see&hellip;..</p>
