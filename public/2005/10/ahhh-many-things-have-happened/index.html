			<p>Ahhh, many things have happened since my last post. I went to seattle to help with <a href="http://www.scinet.supercomp.org/">Scinet</a>, Rebecca and I went to Mexico (cabo san lucas) for vacation, and I&rsquo;ve been preparing for my return trip to Seattle for <a href="http://www.sc05.org/">Supercomputing &lsquo;05</a>. The one thing I hate about travel is that it interrupts my training schedule. I especially miss the submission wrestling and jiu jitsu, I even miss the conditioning. I had to miss 2 submission tournaments and have to miss one more. Kinda sucks, I have not done a tournament in a year now and really want to test myself again. Anyway, some exciting stuff is going on, working with the smart guys over at the pfsense project&hellip;&hellip;just wait and see what comes out next. All of you router monkeys are going to like it&hellip;.a lot. I&rsquo;m also itching to do another tri or duathlon. I&rsquo;m toying with the idea of doing one of the indoor ones in Janurary. Who knows&hellip;.. I&rsquo;ll post some pics from my next trip to Seattle (BTW, Seattle is very, very cool).</p>
