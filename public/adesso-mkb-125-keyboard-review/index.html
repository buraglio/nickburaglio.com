            <p>Are you old enough to remember the amazing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard">IBM model M keyboard</a>s?  I am.  And I loved mine.  I had  several of them as did my roommate from that time.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/800px-ModelM.jpg"><img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/800px-ModelM.jpg" alt="800px-ModelM" /></a>I remember in the mid 1990s working for a consulting firm in central IL, and during that employment one of the tasks put to us was to install a network with new PCs.  Since this was a large company we were doing this for, they wanted to write off all of their items being replaced (or so I was told), so we threw the old stuff into a gigantic dumpster.  During that install, we trashed likely more than 100 IBM Mechanical &ldquo;clicky&rdquo; keyboards.  A few of us were devious enough to stow a few away. Several of us them for close to a decade after.</p>

<p>Now get in your DeLorean and head to 2013.  I&rsquo;ve started a new job and I hear that unmistakable sound of a clicky-clack keyboard from some folks I work with.  It&rsquo;s oh-so-familiar and I&rsquo;m whisked away to a carefree time of gaming, learning Linux and BSD and drinking crummy beer around a table of nerds with computers. Then there was an email thread about the keyboards. I got interested again. After a bit of googling around I found that there is a very, <a href="http://www.clickykeyboards.com/">very large following for the clickey model M-style keyboards</a>. And there is a lot of detail and difference between key styles.  Not surprising, they&rsquo;re great devices and apparent;y far more diverse than I ever knew. So, I set out to find a reasonably priced, modern interface (read:USB) mechanical keyboard.  After much deliberation, I settled on the  <a href="http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-123.html">Adesso MKB-125 keyboard</a>.  It seems like a good compromise between function, form and cost and is available for about $60 from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Adesso-Compact-Mechanical-Keyboard-MKB-125B/dp/B0038KLIPA">Amazon</a>. Now, I&rsquo;ve been using an Apple &ldquo;chicklet&rdquo; keyboard for years.  Since they came out, actually, and I can say with confidence that I like it.  The tactile response is nowhere near as good, but after 6+ years, it&rsquo;s muscle memory, and I knew the MKB-125 would be different in many ways. That being said, this review isn&rsquo;t really a &ldquo;review&rdquo; per se, it&rsquo;s a detailing of the things that someone that has been using a very different keyboard would experience when switching to this device.  It should be said that I love this keyboard.  I&rsquo;m going to buy another one for home to replace my apple keyboard there.  However, it is requiring a re-training of my habits.  Some of the things I experienced that I did not expect (but perhaps should have) are detailed below. <strong>Lack of special apple keys.  </strong>I did not realize just how much I used the keyboard volume keys as well as the mission control stuff.  There are ways to re-map some of it (although I&rsquo;ve not found a way to do the volume yet), mission control stuff is all available via hotkeys.  I&rsquo;m still working through this. <strong>Tiny space bar.</strong>  I didn&rsquo;t catch this one.  It&rsquo;s still annoying, but I purposely got a compact keyboard.  I should have seen it coming but didn&rsquo;t.  My hands are slowly learning that the alt key isn&rsquo;t the spacebar.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3895.jpg"><img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3895-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_3895" /></a></p>

<p><strong>Misplaced ESC key.</strong> This is irritating.  Again, I know I got the compact keyboard, but I never realized just how much muscle memory was there for that esc. key.  <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3894.jpg"><img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/IMG_3894-1024x768.jpg" alt="IMG_3894" /></a></p>

<p><strong>No support for num-lock on mac</strong>? Have not figured this one out yet.  It doesn&rsquo;t claim mac support, so who knows.  I have done zero investigation but I have lamented it a fair amount. <strong>Lack of USB hub.</strong> Again, this could have been solved by getting the <a href="http://www.adesso.com/products/product-detail-124.html">MKB-135B</a> for roughly $15 more.  Perhaps I&rsquo;ll get that one for home. <strong>Noise.</strong>  These things are <em><strong>loud</strong></em>.  If you forget to mute on a conference call or video conference and start typing, everyone will know.  If you have little kids and want to work while they sleep in the next room, that&rsquo;s a crap shoot.  They&rsquo;re that loud. All that being said, I love this keyboard.  The mechanical keys are audibly reinforcing and I very much like the tactile response.  It&rsquo;s both nostalgic and useful.  It reminds me of being in high school around 1991 and learning <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> on an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_System/2">IBM PS/2</a>. I would highly recommend anyone who spends serious amount of time writing code, prose or any other typing-intensive tasks to seriously consider a mechanical keyboard.  There are <a href="http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide">many guides out there</a> to help you decide what is right for you and you&rsquo;ll be surprised at how much you like it.</p>
