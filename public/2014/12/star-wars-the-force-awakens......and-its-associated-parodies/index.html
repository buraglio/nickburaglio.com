			<p>I am and always have been a huge Star Wars fan. I am old enough to remember ESB and lucky enough to have seen ROTJ in the theater. However, I, like many die hard fans, was completely turned off by EP 1, 2 and 3. So much so that I have erased them from my memory and consider them to never have existed. That is why I wasn&rsquo;t terribly excited when I heard that there was a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/">new one being released</a> (and being directed by <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0009190/?ref_=tt_ov_dr">J.J. Abrams</a>).<img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/jar-jar-binks.jpg" alt="jar-jar-binks" />   And then I saw the trailer. Wow. Fantastic. I was excited again. I <em>want</em> to see this one. Now, that&rsquo;s not why I&rsquo;ve made this post. The reason for this post is because not only is there <strong>A NEW STAR WARS MOVIE COMING OUT</strong>, it appears to <em>not</em> suck. And there are a TON of great parodies of the trailer. Hysterical trailers. I&rsquo;ve compiled a few of them here. Official Trailer:  SNL Parody:</p>

<p>Guardians of the Galaxy trailer; you knew this would come and it is worth the watch: Lego version; also pretty funny: &ldquo;George Lucas special Edition&rdquo; parody; had to be done, he deserves it for making me wait in line for a day to have my experienced ruined by <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Jar_Jar_Binks">Jar-Jar Binks</a>: Even a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0094012/">spaceballs</a> version: Enjoy, Star Wars Fans, it looks like Boba Fett may have dragged this franchise out of the saarlacc pit.</p>
