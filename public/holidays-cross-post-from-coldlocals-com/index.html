            <p>--I feel that this post is worthy of a cross post from <a href="http://www.coldlocals.com/">coldlocals.com</a> since it is a very important topic for me.</p>

<p>This time of year always reminds me of a time in my life that was a pivotal, life changing period for me.  In 1988, I was transitioning out of BMX and BMX Freestyle and was looking for something individual, something I could do that didn&rsquo;t require a team or a group but was something I could do myself, as an individual.<br />
I had a few friends that felt the same way, we really just wanted some way to express ourselves that was a little nonconformist, more individual and where social, economic or any other categorization made no difference.<br />
BMX tried to meet this bill, but it was a bit of an outcast elitist club.  It required a large investment, which I made with the help of my parents and a paper route, but it still felt too &hellip;&hellip;connected and beau monde, especially in our small town and area of Illinois.<br />
In small town midwest america, this is pretty common.  If you&rsquo;re not in, you&rsquo;re out, or at best you&rsquo;re on the periphery.  I didn&rsquo;t want that.  I already felt a tad alienated having been an only child for 12 years and suddenly having 2 brothers I had to share my oversubscribed, working parents with.<br />
The late fall of my 8th grade year 2 new kids moved to town. Both were from out of state and both were obviously a bit different than the standard mid Illinois small town kids.  They skated.  They were both cool and very open about skating.  They were happy to kick around on a board with whoever wanted to.<br />
I had investigated skateboarding around 1984 and found it difficult and frustrating.  The problem was that I didn&rsquo;t have a good grasp of how the equipment worked or anyone that could show me the proper way to do anything.  Also, I had a Valterra, which was a low quality excuse for a decent setup.<br />
That had now changed. I had not one, but two independent examples of skateboarding.  One from the east coast, one from the west.<br />
I was sold.  I had to learn this. This was my entry into a life defining part of my existence.  For Christmas my mom drove me the 30 minutes to the <a href="http://decaturbicycle.com/">decatur bike shoppe</a>.  This was the only place I knew that had skateboards as I&rsquo;d seen them when I was there getting BMX parts.  I toiled over what to buy, this and a few shirts were to be my christmas present.  The clothing was a required part of the gift, I was able to sweet talk her into letting me get some skate shirts.<br />
I had absolutely no idea what was necessary. I had enough money to get a deck, grip tape and that&rsquo;s basically it.  I had to use the trucks and wheels from my 1984 Valterra (which didn&rsquo;t fit right) on this new acquisition.<br />
I chose (based on the graphic) the Vision Psycho Stick.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.designdrops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/vision-skateboard-deck.jpg"><img src="http://www.designdrops.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/vision-skateboard-deck.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>This deck was &hellip;.awful.  In retrospect it had a terrible shape and was awkward to ride.  </p>

<p>I had no idea, but I was ecstatic.  I was allowed to pick out a few shirts as well, which to this day were some of my most coveted and prized possessions.  These were also selected based on graphics since I&rsquo;d seen to skate videos and had only really read a handful of <a href="http://skateboarding.transworld.net/">Transworld</a> and (my preferred) <a href="http://www.thrashermagazine.com/">Thrasher Magazine</a>.  It should be noted that I kept a thrasher subscription, nearly nonstop until 2004.  </p>

<p>For my shirts, I chose</p>

<p>A Kevin Staab pirate shirt:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.retroskatestickers.com/gal/sims/img/kevin-staab.jpg"><img src="http://www.retroskatestickers.com/gal/sims/img/kevin-staab.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>A Mark Gonzalez mermaid shirt:</p>

<p><a href="http://retroskatestickers.com/store/images/medium/vis_gonz-mermaid_MED.jpg"><img src="http://retroskatestickers.com/store/images/medium/vis_gonz-mermaid_MED.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>And a powell peralta bones ripper shirt:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.retroskatestickers.com/gal/powellperalta/img/ripper.jpg"><img src="http://www.retroskatestickers.com/gal/powellperalta/img/ripper.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>The gonz mermaid was one of my most prized possessions until its demise in the mid 2000s&hellip;.nearly 15  years after I got it.  </p>

<p>I wore those shirts and skated in my parents garage in bitter cold for the entire season.  I coud not spend enough time on that board.  It be a defining element in my life, something that shapes me, and that I miss terribly to this day, at almost 40 years old.    </p>

<p>This time of year always makes me lament the time I wasted away back then.  I could have skated more.  I should have.  I wouldn&rsquo;t trade it for the world. It&rsquo;s one of my fondest memories.  </p>

<p>I skated nearly every day from 1988 until 1996 and at least few times a week until 2004.  I would still skate if I had any cartilage left in my knees.</p>
