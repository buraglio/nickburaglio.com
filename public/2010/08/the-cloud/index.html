			<p>Outside of networking (and even within networking to a certain extent), the buzzword of the day is &ldquo;The cloud&rdquo;.  All of your data will be in &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;.  Think <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)">Skynet</a>.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing">Cloud computing</a> is how much of our data is handled today.<br />
What is that, you ask?  <br />
&ldquo;<strong>Cloud computing</strong> is <a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Internet" title="Internet">Internet</a>-based <a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Computing" title="Computing">computing</a>, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to <a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Computer" title="Computer">computers</a>and other devices on demand, like the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Electricity_grid" title="Electricity grid">electricity grid</a>.&rdquo;  &ndash;According to wikipedia.  <br />
Why is this even remotely interesting?  Well, as of now, much of what I do has been moved into &ldquo;the cloud&rdquo;. My contacts are stored within google&rsquo;s massive cloud, as are my emails, calendar, and now this blog text.  <br />
I have an Android based phone now, even the config that my phone is built from is in the cloud.  I&rsquo;ve moved my photos into <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio">flickr</a>.  My mail is a Google Apps domain.  Why would I do such a thing, you ask?  Because it&rsquo;s REALLY freakin&rsquo; convenient.  I don&rsquo;t have to run a server anymore.  I don&rsquo;t need to keep up spamassassin signatures or maintain any postgres or mysql databases.  <br />
Its also scary.  All of my data is not under my control anymore.  Once it hits the internet, it&rsquo;s never possible to know for sure it&rsquo;s gone should I want it removed.  This is a frightening thing when one considers the privacy ramifications.  I&rsquo;ve been slowly moving to this model over the last 5 or 6 years.  I was an early beta tester for the google apps and moved my mail around 2005.  Other data has been slowly migrating since then.  </p>

<p>Security is not convenient, and convenient is not often secure.  Lets hope our cloud overlords take pity on us when they take over the world.</p>
