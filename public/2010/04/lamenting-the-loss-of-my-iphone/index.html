			<p>Last weekend my son put my wife&rsquo;s iPhone in the dog water. Needless to say, it didn&rsquo;t survive. Since I had an old Blackberry 8100 I decided to give my iPhone to her and take the Blackberry until we could either replace or repair her damaged phone. This was a much harder transition that I had anticipated. I used the 8100 &ldquo;Pearl&rdquo; for about 6 months before upgrading to the original iPhone back in 2007 and had no issues with it. In fact, I thought it was a pretty nice device. However, after using the very user friendly and application rich iPhone for nearly 3 years, I came to discover that it was exceedingly difficult to transition back to the Blackberry.<br />
I had no idea how much I depended on my phone for entertainment, work, scheduling and just basic tasks until it wasn&rsquo;t there anymore.<br />
It was also a bit of an eye opening experience to see some of the very rudimentary things that an iPhone just can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t do that I had forgotten. Even though I&rsquo;m sure that these are documented and discussed ad nauseam all over the internet, I wanted to put them here as a reminder to myself.</p>

<p>iPhone:<br />
Can sync with my calendar, work and personal email and with a jailbreak, both my google calendar and exchange calendar.<br />
Display web content as a full web browser<br />
Use google voice web page<br />
Can&rsquo;t integrate google voice within other apps.<br />
Can&rsquo;t change the sms tone to a user provided sound*(!!!!!)<br />
can sync seamlessly with my mac address book.<br />
Seems a bit fragile.<br />
Limits apps to apple approved only*</p>

<p>*some of this is available with jailbreak, but it&rsquo;s a hack and totally unsupported, makes upgrading the software more of a chore, etc.</p>

<p>Blackberry pearl 8100:<br />
is SLOOOOOOOOOOW<br />
Has no wifi<br />
Using BIS, can&rsquo;t seem to sync mail and mail flags correctly for both of my email accounts<br />
Has an AWFUL calendar interface<br />
can integrate most google apps, including voice, right into the menu system.<br />
Can&rsquo;t do more than one exchange account.<br />
It&rsquo;s feels indestructible.<br />
It lets me install the apps that I want, no questions.</p>

<p>I am seriously considering a <a href="http://www.google.com/phone">Nexus One</a> for ATT but I&rsquo;d rather not shell out the $550 to get it.</p>

<p>We sent the water damaged phone off to <a href="http://www.ubreakifix.com/">UBreakIFix.com</a> to get repaired. I believe it will arrive back today (sent monday, arrived, was fixed and returned Wednesday). We&rsquo;ll see how well it works now.<br />
I&rsquo;ll post a review of my experience with <a href="http://www.ubreakifix.com/">UBreakIFix.com</a> once I get a chance.</p>
