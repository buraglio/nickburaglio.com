<p>Several folks have complained that my daily <a href="http://twitter.com/buraglio">twitter</a> summaries are a bit too chatty. So, to satisfy the few folks that actually subscribe to the <a href="feed:http://buraglio.com/nick/feed">rss</a> of this blog (that I rarely have time to update lately, thus the twitter feed), I have moved it back to a weekly summary.<br />
There. Stop complaining.</p>

<p>Yeah, those pictures are just random.</p>
