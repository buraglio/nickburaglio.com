			<p>I&rsquo;ve more or less realized that as I get older, my memory retention is getting worse. I have always had a pretty good memory, but it&rsquo;s oddball things that I remember, like quotes from Ghostbusters or my friends phone numbers from grade school.<br />
I&rsquo;ve never been great at taking notes and so, to that end, I&rsquo;ve decided to work on doing just that.<br />
I have taken one of the many oddball domain names that I own, in this case <a href="http://www.coprophage.net/">coprophage.net</a> and started documenting my technical (both work and non-work) related stuff there. I plan to use this site as more of a personal blog and <a href="http://www.coprophage.net/">coprophage.net</a> as my personal tech-diary kinda thing.  I&rsquo;ve already put a few posts up there detailing some Juniper SRX firewall/IDP things I&rsquo;ve run into and have also added a Cisco AAA post.  Mostly I just want to detail some of the things that are odd, have poor documentation, are hard to find answers to or things that I just want to be able to reference later.  So, if you like geeky, network related cisco, juniper, foundry, and security related text, head on over.  Hopefully it won&rsquo;t fizzle out and I can keep it updated.<br />
Don&rsquo;t expect it to be correct all of the time, or even relevant to the current techno-babble-buzzword-of-the-day. It&rsquo;s mostly for me, but if you find it useful, thats great too.</p>

<p>Oh, and yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coprophagia">coprophage</a>is the consumption of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feces" title="Feces">feces</a>.  Why do I own this domain?  Why not, I ask you. Why not.</p>
