			<p>I had been wanting to see the film &ldquo;<a href="http://www.beautifullosers.com/">Beautiful Losers</a>&rdquo; since I&rsquo;d heard of it, and I finally had the opportunity to sit down and really enjoy it.  This is certainly a movie worth your time if you are interested in real artists, living and working like real artists in todays world.<br />
I originally wanted to see this because of the heavy influence from the skateboarding world (a world I spent a very good deal of my youth in) but also because I had always aspired to be an artist (and even went and got a degree in arts and technology).  I have a great deal of respect for folks like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Gonzales">Mark Gonzalez</a> and especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Templeton">Ed Templeton</a>, for their great artwork and their fierce adherence to being creative and living life on their own terms.</p>

<p>Rent this, it&rsquo;s worth your time.</p>
