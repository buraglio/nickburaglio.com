<p>I got a new lens for my Canon XTi&hellip;..a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Canon-50mm-1-8-Camera-Lens/dp/B00007E7JU">Canon EF 50mm f/1.8</a>. Not the most expensive piece of photo equipment, but pretty much a no brainer at $98 for what it gets you.  I&rsquo;ve shot some pretty darned good images with used, low to medium quality pawn shop lenses, so it seemed like a no-thought decision.<br />
 Art is all about subject and inspiration, not equipment quality and technical prowess. Thats something that many folks have a hard time grasping in the photography and video art world.<br />
I&rsquo;m not saying Im great at anything, but I do find it very mentally therapeutic to get out my sketch pad or camera and just capture stuff (not as much as some good submission grappling, but pretty close).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve really been getting back into shooting images lately, only 4 years after my wonderful wife encouraged it by getting me a digital replacement for my old, metal bodied Pentax 1000 that I used before and all through college.  Keep an eye on my <a href="http://www.buraglio.com/pics">flickr photostream</a> if you&rsquo;re interested, I have been publishing quite a bit.</p>
