      <description>One of the gifts I received from my wife this year for the holidays was a Contigo Autoseal Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler, 16 Oz. she knows just how much coffee I consume and shares my love of good, artesian and small roaster coffees. I was excited when I popped this out of the stocking, but I honestly wasn&amp;rsquo;t prepared for just how awesome this mug really is. I generally don&amp;rsquo;t like to use plastic for travel mugs so I have an assortment of stainless steel and ceramic travel mugs.</description>
