			<p>While rooting through a box in my basement, I came across something that I had no idea I still had. It was my very first watch, a cat-in-the-hat winder. I remember receiving this little treasure as a gift for xmas, probably around 1980. I was really young so memories are a little hazy, but I do remember wearing it proudly to grade school on it&rsquo;s black leather band (now lost). I pulled this thing out of that box and it was like a blast from the past. Now that I have a 7 week old son, I find myself thinking about stuff I never, ever thought I&rsquo;d spend mental cycles on, what kinds of things will he remember when he is my age? Will he save everything like I apparently did?<br />
Amazingly enough, this watch still works. It&rsquo;s a hand winder with some kind of a swiss movement. On the case back it reads:</p>

<p><strong>Lafayette Watch Co<br />
Swiss Made<br />
Base Metal<br />
26002</strong></p>

<p>The &ldquo;crystal&rdquo; appears to be some kind of hard plastic and it&rsquo;s fairly scuffed but it actually keeps decent time. My mother could not believe that I still had it.</p>

<p>Now, if I could only find a replacement for my first digital watch.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.chronophile.com/index_files/Armitron-Digital-Sun-and-Moon.php">This</a> is the only reference I have ever seen to one of these. It was probably my all time favorite watch, I remember when it stopped working. I was pretty bummed. Mine was black and I remember receiving it as well. Great memories.</p>
