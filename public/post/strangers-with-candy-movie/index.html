			<p>One of the greatesst shows of all times is coming to the bug screen! I&rsquo;ve been waiting for this for a LONG time. <a href="http://strangerswithcandymovie.com/">Strangers with Candy</a>, one of the least PC and smartest shows to come out of Comedy Central is coming to theaters this month. I have a feeling that I&rsquo;ll have to wait for it to make it to Champaign, IL but hopefully it&rsquo;ll be worth it. I absolutely loved this show, as did many of my friends, but alas, many did not (or don&rsquo;t) appreciate it&rsquo;s humor much like many of the shows I enjoy[ed].<br />
Anyway, supposedly the &ldquo;new&rdquo; show &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always sunny in Philadelphia&rdquo; is just as, if not more crass. I&rsquo;ve been looking for the first season and just set up a season pass on my tivo for this season. We&rsquo;ll see if it can live up to my expectations.</p>

<p>There is nothing better than comedy that takes no prisoners and pulls no punches.</p>
