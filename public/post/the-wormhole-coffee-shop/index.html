			<p>The video of <a href="http://www.thewormholecoffee.com/_/Welcome.html">The Wormhole Coffee Shop</a> was sent to my by my younger brother today. This place looks to be so full of awesome; I had to watch this video twice. It&rsquo;s like my childhood and my adulthood had a baby and that baby was an amazingly cool coffee shop! What is not to like about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine">Doc Brown&rsquo;s DeLorean Time Machine</a>!?!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never been there, but as soon as I get back up the Chicago area, I&rsquo;ll be making a special trip to get some coffee at this place.  Any place that has a coffee <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76Lr1nBXCNg&amp;feature=player_embedded">drink named after a Ghostbusters character</a> has to be pretty cool.</p>
