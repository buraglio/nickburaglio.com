			<p>the first day was beautiful. Weatherwas great, no wind and low humidity. All of the volunteers did a bang up job. One can really teL how much they care about supporting those raising money to help cure MS. Rebecca had a tire blow out in the first 3 miles but got it fixed and finished the 35 with no problem. I did the 75 as did Jeff, Scott, Vic and Jeff&rsquo;s friend. John did the full century, everyone else did the 35. Now we&rsquo;re off for dinner and sleep and do it all again tomorrow.</p>
