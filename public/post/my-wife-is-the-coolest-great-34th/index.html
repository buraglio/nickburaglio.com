			<p>My wife is super cool. Not only is she a great mom to our <a href="http://www.buraglio.com/luke/">son</a>, she&rsquo;s smart, hot and actually listens to me when I talk about stuff I <strong>know</strong> she&rsquo;s not interested in. Case in point, my birthday. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of watches and timepieces, and shes bought me several watches for my collection over the years.<br />
This year we are a little busy and I actually forgot about my own birthday until she reminded me. All that aside, I&rsquo;d been reading up on watches on my paternity leave from work and really learning about movement types, etc.<br />
I&rsquo;d been rambling (possibly incoherently) on about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_watch">automatic watch movements</a> for a few weeks and mentioned how I thought that it was cool that Orient still did their own automatic movement even after Seiko had purchased them.<br />
Well, low and behold, she got me an <a href="http://www.discountwatchstore.com/store-products-Orient-2ER00001B-Orient-Mens-Automatic-Watch-2ER00001B_40014955.html">Orient Dive watch</a>&hellip;which I had planned on buying for myself at some point. That is cool enough, but she went above and beyond and got me a sweet zulu band for it from <a href="http://panatime.com/20zubany5pvd.html">Panatime</a>, probably the best source for getting bands.<br />
I am truly blessed.</p>
