<p>What a sweet little boo. Sorry for your loss my friend. I think I live by this unknown authors words: &ldquo;heaven will not ever Heaven be Unless my cats are there to welcome me.&rdquo; And for people like you I think are best described by the following: &ldquo;We can judge the heart of a man by his treatment of animals.&rdquo; â€“ Immanual Kant
