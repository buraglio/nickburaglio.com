			<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about moving this blog over to movable type due to the more user friendly and extendable nature of it, even though I don&rsquo;t like the idea of a mysql backend (my old MT install just uses sqlite).  With the useful iphone support and ease of use It just seems like the right thing to do&hellip;..and since it&rsquo;s already pretty much done, here it is.  Note the cheery default color scheme (6/27/2008, it&rsquo;s probably going to change&hellip;..)</p>
