			<p>I&rsquo;m liking the move back to blogger so far. I do miss some of the flexibility that wordpress gave me, but overall I&rsquo;m willing to trade that for not running a database server anymore.  Blogger is available over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a> using the <a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/">google over any v6</a> resolvers, which is very cool, and the VPS I moved to at <a href="https://www.arpnetworks.com/">ARP networks</a> to host DNS and basic HTTP is also fully v6 native.<br />
I&rsquo;m also really, really liking the move to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio/">flickr</a> for my photo hosting.  I paid for a pro account and have been very pleased with the integration and wealth of tools and apps.<br />
I have to say, though, that the entire reason that this move was spawned (other than the fact that I&rsquo;ve been thinking about it for a while) is that I installed an app called <a href="http://blog.350nice.com/wp/products/picpush">PicPush</a> on my Android Nexus One .<br />
This app allows me to automatically publish all images taken with my android device with 0 user intervention (and allows for a timer to to so; I have mine set to 15 minutes).<br />
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio/sets/72157624667024904/">Here</a> you can find all of the images in my &ldquo;Mobile&rdquo; flickr set.  There are things in there from as far back as my Treo 600, but most of the stuff is relatively new and always updating as I snap images.</p>
