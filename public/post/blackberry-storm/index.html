			<p>A lot of folks have asked me about the <a href="http://www.phonescoop.com/phones/phone.php?p=1864">Blackberry Storm</a>. Well, it looks like an impressive device, and if I still had Verizon Wireless and didn&rsquo;t already have an iphone 3g, I&rsquo;d very likely have one of these.<br />
Rumors were flying about initial firmware issues, sluggish behavior and general buggyness, but it appears that they&rsquo;ve been working on the problems and have fixes either on the way or <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2008/12/05/verizon-posts-its-first-blackberry-storm-firmware-update/">already here</a>. <a href="http://www.howardchui.com/">Howard</a> over at <a href="http://www.howardforums.com/">Howard Forums</a> did a decent review, check it out here:</p>

<p>The only caveat I can think of is that there has always been poor mac support for Blackberries, so if you&rsquo;re a Mac user like me, you may want to check the options.<br />
