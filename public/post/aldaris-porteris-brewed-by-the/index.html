<h3 id="aldaris-porteris">Aldaris Porteris</h3>

<p>Brewed by the Alderis Brewery in Riga, Latvia, this 6.8 percent alc. porter was not too heavy and not too sweet. A quick, carmel aftertast, it was a pleasant surprise of a porter for $2.49 at friar tuck. I love a good porter, it&rsquo;s a fact. Dark and sweet ( but not too sweet ) I would recommend this delicious drink for any porter lover. A little heavy but VERY good.</p>
