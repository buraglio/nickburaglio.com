			<p>This Movie / Documentary looks very cool. IT should be playing at <a href="http://www.boardmansarttheatre.com/">Boardman&rsquo;s</a> soon. This guy is crazy, but it kinda makes sense.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s getting great reviews:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;I am afraid of heights. Now you know. That is one reason I was helplessly engrossed in &ldquo;Man on Wire,&rdquo; the story of how Philippe Petit crossed eight times on a tight-wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center on Aug. 7, 1974. Another reason is that the documentary, a hybrid of actual and restaged footage, is constructed like a first-rate thriller.&ldquo;- Roger Ebert * * * *</em></p>

<p><em>&ldquo;James Marsh&rsquo;s brilliant documentary on a Frenchman&rsquo;s 1974 high-wire walk between the twin towers has the pace of a thriller and the human interest of a psychological drama.&rdquo;- LA Times</em></p>
