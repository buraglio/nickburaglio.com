			<p>With the impending release of the iPhone firmware 1.1.3 there are a lot of additions, most important to me being the inclusion of multi recipient SMS messages (something that should have been there from day one). <a href="http://cre.ations.net/blog/post/iphone-113-home-screen-rearrangement-video">cre.ations.net</a> has a video of one of the other cool features, movable icons (something available with a jailbroken iPhone for a long time). Anyway, it&rsquo;s nice to see apple actually including it. I&rsquo;m still waiting to see the *actual* release date, it&rsquo;ll probably be around Macworld, but who knows. &hellip;now all they need is MMS to be compliant with phones from 2003. <img src="http://cre.ations.net/image/view/640/2395" alt="" /></p>
