			<p>I happen to love t-shirts. I&rsquo;d be so bold as to say that I collect them, especially shirts that remind me of growing up. A group of us were talking about <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0100802/">Total Recall</a>, Kuato specifically, and I thought it would be cool to have a Kuato Lives shirt. Low and behold, someone else has already done it!

I think I may order one. Quaid, open your mind to him&hellip;.</p>
