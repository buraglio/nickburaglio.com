			<p>A few days ago I received a package in the mail that I wasn&rsquo;t<br />
expecting. Anticipation was high. What could it be? As I opened it<br />
up I realized that it was my ipod, back from (dis)repair. I had<br />
requested one thing only of them. Return it to me in the same<br />
condition and with the same abilities that it had had for the last 2<br />
years. HFS+ formatted and able to use the firewire cable that it<br />
came with. While I realize that they need to cater to the droves of<br />
clueless windows users, it would be nice to have some one at least a<br />
*little* clued about mac products that they sell in their own<br />
stores. I am convinced that the ipod I got back originally was not<br />
completely fixed, I was unable to use it at all with my firewire<br />
cable, nor were they (on a PC) but it worked fine with a USB cable,<br />
of which I don&rsquo;t have (and don&rsquo;t care to use). So I returned it and<br />
argued with the guy who continuously tried to &ldquo;word rumble&rdquo; with me.<br />
OK, fine. Just get the damned thing fixed. I like to go and pick it<br />
up in the store because I&rsquo;m not confident in their repair service.<br />
Upon getting my device back I want them to demonstrate that it<br />
actually works (yeah, I&rsquo;m that customer). Well, even though I<br />
requested that at the time of drop off it was sent to my house,<br />
windows formatted. Needless to say, I was livid. After cooling off<br />
for a minute I thought that a good test to see if they did their job<br />
would be to actually use it. So I tried and low and behold it<br />
actually worked without clicking and grinding (like after the last<br />
repair) and with my own firewire cable on my own mac. It even let me<br />
restore it HFS+. I&rsquo;m happy with this. The moral of this blurb is<br />
that even though the &ldquo;geek squad&rdquo; got me my desired result they<br />
aren&rsquo;t the best source for getting something fixed. I&rsquo;d never<br />
recommend them to anyone.</p>
