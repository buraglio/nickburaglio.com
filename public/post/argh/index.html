			<p>I&rsquo;m a little frustrated with the Wordpress conversion, overall I think it&rsquo;s probably better than movable type, but the primary driver for making the changeover was so that I could use the mobile support that came out for the iPhone. Well, I seem to be running into a fairly common bug in it, in that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be able to read my configuration or write to my pages.<br />
I&rsquo;m quite confident that it is either<br />
a. something I need to tweak, or<br />
b. something that will be fixed soon if it is in fact a bug.<br />
I&rsquo;ll probably did a little deeper into it tonight to make sure that it isn&rsquo;t a problem on my end.</p>

<p>Either way, I&rsquo;m looking forward to being able to shoot photos up here directly from my iPhone&hellip;.<br />
It should be fun.</p>
