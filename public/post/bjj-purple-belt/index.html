			<p>This week I received a Purple belt in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BJJ">Brazilian Jiu Jitsu</a> under <a href="http://www.jackmcvicker.com/">Jack McVicker</a>. Having trained in bjj since about 2002 under <a href="http://www.jackmcvicker.com/">Jack</a>, it was a very great honor to receive this promotion. Training with the high level guys that I work with several times a week certainly helps progression of skill and technique, of course having great instruction doesn&rsquo;t hurt either.</p>

<p>So, since bjj.org is pretty much gone and their &ldquo;Instructor Lineages&rdquo; page has gone with it, here is the progression of my rank:<br />
