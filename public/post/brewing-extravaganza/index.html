			<p>Since I&rsquo;ve aggravated a (likely very old) back injury once again and can&rsquo;t train or work out nearly as much as I used to until it&rsquo;s healed, I have decided to try my hand at making beer&hellip;.and wine (or is it cider?)&hellip;.and mead&hellip;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gone a little overboard.</p>

<p><img src="http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/d/9612-1/IMG_1288.JPG" alt="" /></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve bottled my <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/English-Brown-Ale/">first batch</a>, an English Brown ale, and after bottle conditioning for about 2 weeks it&rsquo;s actually pretty darned good. Nice and clear, not cloudy like I would have expected. I got a little anxious waiting for the beer so I threw together <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/Ancient-Orange-Mead/">a spiced orange mead</a> based on the recipe <a href="http://www.moremead.com/mead_logs/Ancient_OCC.html">Ancient Orange Cinnamon &amp; Clove Mead</a>.</p>

<p>Cut to 3 weeks later&hellip;.I now have a <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/VanillaPorter/">Vanilla Porter</a>, a batch of <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/apfelwein/">Apfelwein</a> and a 1 Gallon batch of <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/gallery2/v/Beers/CherryGrapeMead/">Cherry Grape Mead</a>.<br />

I can&rsquo;t wait to try the porter, it should be great. The apfelwein I&rsquo;ll likely give away most of unless Rebecca likes it since I don&rsquo;t really drink wine or cider (plus I have 5 gallons of it!).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very excited about the mead. I&rsquo;ve really only had mead once and I enjoyed the flavor very much.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found some really good resources for brewing, too. <a href="http://www.howtobrew.com/">How to brew</a> (site and book) has everything any beginning (or experienced) brewer would ever want to know. The message board <a href="http://homebrewtalk.com/">Home Brew Talk</a> also has a wealth of very knowledgeable and friendly folks over there. I&rsquo;ve found that site to be indispensable so far.<br />
It&rsquo;s a fun hobby. I find myself spending a lot of time at night reading recipes and techniques then itching to try them out&hellip;</p>
