			<p>Several people have mentioned triathlons to me in the last 2 weeks, which has me thinking&hellip;..could my injury riddled body, damaged from years of skateboarding, distance running, boxing and submission wrestling handle another triathlon?<br />
I have not participated in one since 2006, and really not trained properly for one since 2005&hellip;..I have also not run any event runs or races since 2007 (or run at all since 2007 due to my very beat-to-hell back). Could I participate, perhaps not quite as competitively, in something like a sprint tri?<br />
I should be able to train very little and still have no issues with something like a sprint&hellip;.at least in my mind. The last event run I ran I did without training at all and finished respectably.</p>

<p>My limitations are annoying me lately. No more boxing. No more running. No more skateboarding.<br />
Maybe I lived too hard, was too hard on my back and knees&hellip;.who knows. I guess maybe I used up all of my &ldquo;activity capital&rdquo; when I was younger.<br />
I did get the ol skateboard out the other morning and kicked around, just to prove that I could still at least do a few tricks cold. It was also a decent excuse for messing with iMovie 09. Here are the results:</p>

<p>My back didn&rsquo;t hurt <em>too</em> bad when I was done. I may try and do the local sprint tri this year. It&rsquo;s short enough and easy enough that I can probably do it with minimal prep and and it may just satisfy my need to prove to myself that I&rsquo;m not totally falling apart.</p>
