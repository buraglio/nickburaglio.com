			<p>I don&rsquo;t know about you, but I found this incredibly frightening&hellip;<br />
<a href="http://www.thegfloor.co.uk/otherstuff/cashmachinewindows.jpg"><img src="http://www.thegfloor.co.uk/otherstuff/cashmachinewindows.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>With all the talk of the <a href="http://www.ctatattler.com/2006/02/cta_info_screen.html">CTA machines being vulnerable</a> and <a href="http://img26.exs.cx/img26/5349/dsc019149tz.jpg">other MTA</a> machines crashing or being problematic I got to thinking about how many mission critical or sensitive systems are vulnerable, rooted, 0wn3d or whatever. Most Cash machines used to be OS/2 but that&rsquo;s been changing lately and I know for sure some are moving to windows. Lets just hope all these systems are well maintained or more secured than they probably are&hellip;..probably wishful thikning..</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a paranois by nature. I&rsquo;m untrusting. I don&rsquo;t like people very much because most of them are stupid (myself included at times). You know, the more I think about it, it&rsquo;s not really the systems that are most at risk. Social engineering is much easier than r00ting a box and most targets are underpaid, unhappy workers that just don&rsquo;t care. How many bank tellers do you know that are well paid? How many personal assistants to powerful execs have access to their email and desktop machines? If you think it&rsquo;s difficult to talk that info out of one of them you are sorely mistaken. Wow, I made myself even more paranoid by that thought alone&hellip;.Social engineering is often overlooked and ALWAYS a threat.</p>
