			<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for my old toys. I never throw anything away and I still have a huge amount of my toys from the late 70&rsquo;s through the 80&rsquo;s. That is what makes this find so interesting.  I had a few of these &ldquo;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fisher+Price+Adventure+People&amp;oq=Fisher+Price+Adventure+People&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2.493j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;espv=210&amp;es_sm=119&amp;ie=UTF-8">Adventure People</a>&rdquo; manufactured by Fisher Price, and I played with them <strong>a lot,</strong> but I had all but forgotten about them until I pulled this one, the &ldquo;opticon&rdquo;, out of a box my oldest son and I were looking through.  I had no memory of this whatsoever because it was so obscure, until I saw it.  Memories came rushing back, I clearly remembered getting it in Bloomington, IL at what I believe was Montgomery Wards.  There is surprisingly little on these toys on the &lsquo;net, but they are readily available on ebay and there are <a href="http://mosseisley.blogspot.com/2013/09/more-fisher-price-adventure-people.html">collectors out there still able to find carded figures</a>(!!)  The Opticon was pretty cool because of the large crystal in its back and the fact that it folded over into what I always called a &ldquo;sleep&rdquo; mode.  <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_4040.jpg"><img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_4040-225x300.jpg" alt="IMG_4040" /></a></p>

<p>This find drove me to spend far too much time researching these toys, which triggered a few more memories.  I realized that I had possessed a few more toys from this series.  Most notably, I had the space alpha interceptor and the pilot and the opticon (shown above).  I played with that interceptor quite a bit.  It had a really cool design that came apart into a smaller ship or spun around in the middle of the larger chassis and the guy, even though he didn&rsquo;t move much, was very neat with his enclosed head and weird eye goggles.  <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/interceptor.jpg"><img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/interceptor-1024x768.jpg" alt="interceptor" /></a>My belief is that the interceptor is in a box in my parents basement but the guy is probably long gone.  I&rsquo;ll blame my brothers for that (sorry Mike and Chris, blame rolls down hill).  I plan to dig around next time I&rsquo;m down in 61727 and see if I can find it.  until then, I&rsquo;ve handed over the Opticon to my boys to add to the arsenal of other vintage stuff for hours of adventure.</p>
