			<p>In the last few weeks I&rsquo;ve been in what can only be described as a mission to taste as much good beer as I can.Â  On the short list, all of the stuff at the the <a href="http://www.morganstreetbrewery.com/">Morgan St. Brewery</a> in STL<img src="http://photos-b.ak.facebook.com/photos-ak-sf2p/v323/186/92/1954800/n1954800_45122209_7019.jpg" alt="morgan st brewery" /><br />
(the dark wheat was excellent, as was the altbier).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been on a Belgian Ale kick, having just bottled mine a few days ago. The <a href="http://www.ratebeer.com/beer/hoppin-frog-gulden-fraug/65880/61657/">Hoppin&rsquo; Frog Belgian Strong ale</a> is a favorite of mine.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s also <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oktoberfest">Oktoberfest</a> season, always my favorite time of year. My Oktoberfest was made late so it won&rsquo;t really be ready until December but it should be good as well.<br />
I&rsquo;d like to get my 15 Gallon kettle going so I can make some double batches and get my kegs going as well but that will likely come a little later.</p>
