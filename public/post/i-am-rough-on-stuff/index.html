			<p>I am rough on stuff. I needed a good case for my Treo 650. I had many a choice in this area but was patricularly interested in the rubber &ldquo;skin&rdquo; type cases. I have wanted one of these for my ipod but never got around to getting one. I did a little readong and decided on the <a href="http://www.speckproducts.com/">Spec Products</a> <a href="http://www.speckproducts.com/treo650.html">Skintight</a> case. I liked the fact that it had a sscreen cover that I could remomve if needed and came with a holster for when I was feeling particularly geeky and wanted to wear it on my pocket (which is rare). It was a little pricey at <a href="http://shop.treonauts.com/content/accessories/4-54--295.htm">$34.99 from Treonauts</a> but work was paying so I went for it. My initial impressions were good, I opted for the Black case to &ldquo;hide&rdquo; dirt. The installation was simple, quick and painless. It covers and protects nicely. I&rsquo;m a pretty pickey person when it comes to something I use every day (otherwise I generally don&rsquo;t care) so I&rsquo;ll point out some of the things I _didn&rsquo;t_ think about.</p>

<p>1. I like to keep stuff in my pockets, the case has a friction to it that pretty much disallows this when I&rsquo;m wearing jeans. No big deal I can just clip the case to my pocket or belt.</p>

<p>2. The way the clip works is not conducive to using an SD card. The clip pushes out my SD card every time I put the treo in it. Very annoying to say the least.</p>

<p>3. I can&rsquo;t get to the SD card easily if I want to change it. This really doesnt occur often, but it&rsquo;s still something I didn;t think about.</p>

<p>4. I can&rsquo;t beam stuff from the Treo because the IR port, like the SD card port is protected by the case.</p>

<p>5. I can&rsquo;t easily do a soft reset without removing it from the case.</p>

<p>Again, I think this is a really good case, I think it is a very nice compromise of form and function, these are just things that I didn&rsquo;t think about (or didn&rsquo;t research enough before making my purchase). I would recommend this case to those that, like me, are rough on their gadgets. I have been extremely pleased with how well this has protected my Treo650 in the 3 weeks that I&rsquo;ve had it so far.</p>

<p>The plus sides are many:</p>

<p>Cutout for camera. (I don&rsquo;t really use the camera much but it&rsquo;s available if needed)<br />
Easy to use, removeable flip up screen cover<br />
Cutout for mute toggle, stylus, dock / power and side buttons<br />
Can take a beating<br />
does not cover keyboard, making for easy use.<br />
not overly expensive</p>

<p>For those that are even more rough on their gadgets than me, there is a <a href="http://www.speckproducts.com/treo650ts.html">Ruggedized version</a> available for the same price.<br />
I&rsquo;d like to try out the <a href="http://shop.treonauts.com/content/accessories/4-54--137.htm">Smartphone Experts S650 Skin Case</a> as soon as I can get around to buying it. If someone wants to donate it thats be great too, I&rsquo;d be happy to write a &ldquo;regular guy&rdquo; review of it.</p>
