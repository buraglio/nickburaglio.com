			<p>I&rsquo;m a mac user, I have been for years. I have a (although somewhat outdated) knowledge of hardware and I&rsquo;d like to think I know my way around a Unix system. So when I had a problem with my 20gig ipod I figured if it wasn&rsquo;t hardware I could fix it. Well, it was hardware. My wife got it for me in Feb. of 2004 for my birthday. She got it at best buy, and knowing how I am rough on stuff, she bought the extended warranty from them, giving it coverage till <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>2008</sub>. OK, they sent it off and supposedly replaced the drive. Great. I pick it up and take it home. What a big surprise, it&rsquo;s formatted as a windows ipod. No problem, it should still work. No dice.<br />
Lovely messages in the logs:<br />

<p>I can&rsquo;t find much on these errors while googling around. Damnit. What a pain. It is also making a terrible clicky clack while plugged in. I drag the old XP machine out of the closet and plug it into the PCI firewire card. explorer.exe crashes. OK, I can accept that. This machine is terribly unmaintained. I take it into work and my boss plugs it into his firewire port on his laptop. Same behavior. ::sigh:: I have to take it *back* to best buy. Work and training end and I head off to Best buy.</p>

<p>The Geek Squad guy was nice, not terribly personable (although I wasn&rsquo;t either when I did that kind of PC repair work). He plugged it into a windows PC using a USB cable and it worked flawlessly. WTF?!? OK. I had my powerbook there. I plugged it into my powerbook with his USB cable and it worked. DAMN! OK, I want to restore it as a Mac formatted disk so if needed I can boot from it. No deal, it needs a firewire cable to do so. I plug it into the PB with a FW cable and it fails miserably. By this point I am super frustrated. Maybe it&rsquo;s the firewire Dock cable. They say it&rsquo;s not broken and 5 minutes of me arguing that I can&rsquo;t use it because I</p>

<p>A. <strong>DON&rsquo;T have a USB cable</strong></p>

<p>and</p>

<p>B. <strong>DON&rsquo;T Want it formatted FAT32</strong></p>

<p>ensues. As far as I&rsquo;m concerned if I can&rsquo;t <strong>use</strong> it it&rsquo;s worthless to me. It&rsquo;s an apple product, I should be able to use it as I have for 2 years without issue.</p>

<p>He was not really sympathetic, he&rsquo;s not a mac user and doesn&rsquo;t really seem to understand that all I want is for it to be <strong>THE SAME</strong> as when it was shipped off. Finally after talking to a manager he agrees to send it back with the firewire cable and have it formatted HFS+ and test the cable. OK, another few weeks without it. We&rsquo;ll see if it works when it comes back. Theoretically, if it gets sent off one more time I should get it replaced with a new one. We&rsquo;ll see, I&rsquo;d be willing to bet they fight that tooth and nail.</p>
