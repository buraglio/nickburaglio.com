			<p>I&rsquo;m a bit of a coffee nut. I love good, high quality coffee. I&rsquo;ve written about it <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2013/12/27/greatest-coffee-mug-ive-ever-owned-16oz-contigo-autoseal-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-tumbler/ &quot;Greatest coffee mug I’ve ever owned. (16oz Contigo Autoseal Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler">many</a>&rdquo;), <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2009/01/02/coffee-facts/" title="Coffee Facts">many</a>, <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2006/06/12/coffee-counteracts-alcohol-effects-on-liver/" title="coffee counteracts alcohol effects on liver?">many</a>, <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2011/09/05/caffe-ladro/" title="Caffe Ladro">many</a> times.   In fact, I have a hard time getting going before coffee in the mornings, having been a coffee drinker since I was ~17 (I have no clue how my teeth aren&rsquo;t stained; it baffles the dentist).  I don&rsquo;t drink soda, just coffee, water and beer.  So, when <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/163685099/hey-joe-coffee-mug-brew-joe-on-the-go">a kickstarter for the Hey Joe brewing coffee mug</a> was brought to my attention, I thought &ldquo;wow, why has no one done this before?&rdquo;.  What is it, you ask? It&rsquo;s a battery powered, heating, coffee brewing mug.  That&rsquo;s right. <img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/b4d953c3acb64df68c5d551c8088024e_large.jpg" alt="b4d953c3acb64df68c5d551c8088024e_large" /> My initial reaction to this was &ldquo;ok, I need that.  Now&rdquo;. Anyone that travels and appreciates good coffee could really benefit from this mug.  I like an afternoon coffee, and when I&rsquo;m traveling I have to find a decent place to get it and that is generally not an easy task because I like <em>good</em> coffee, and not over heated, burned coffee served too hot.  I&rsquo;ll often end up with what I call &ldquo;gas station swill&rdquo; which is a poor substitute for decent coffee.  I partake in coffee when I&rsquo;m traveling especially, and hotel coffee is&hellip;less than stellar. Starbucks is&hellip;.consistent.  And over-roasted.  And served too hot.  And too expensive.  I will always seek out a decent mom-and-pop shop but those are hit and miss. I could see myself traveling with this thing.  Lets hope it meets the kickstarter request, because, frankly, I want one.  Check out the video if you don&rsquo;t believe me.    Cool, right?  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hey-joe-coffee-mug-2014-6">Business Insider even thinks so.</a>  I hope it gets funded, it really is a neat idea (and I want one, damnit!).  I can name the number of things I&rsquo;ve donated to on kickstarter on one hand.  This is one of them.</p>
