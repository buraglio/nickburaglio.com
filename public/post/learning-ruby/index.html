			<p>I am not a programmer, but the idea of creating useful software intrigues me. I&rsquo;ve taught myself enough Python to do simple things and I can usually modify and understand most Perl scripting as well as do some stuff in PHP.<br />
Ruby is something that I always heard was really nice (much like Python), so I decided I was going to try and learn some of it. There are some really useful tools for doing things on your OS X mac with ruby (and Python), things like <a href="http://rb-appscript.rubyforge.org/">RB-Appscript</a>, an apple event bridge for Ruby. It allows for applescript functionality within Ruby.<br />
Anyway, I came across <a href="http://www.hawkwings.net/2007/03/01/a-faster-way-to-speed-up-mailapp/">This Mail.app Speedup &ldquo;Hack&rdquo;</a> and decided to write a Ruby script to do it for me when called from the CLI. <a href="http://www.buraglio.com/nick/projects/scripts/Ruby/mailsqueeze.rb">Here</a> is the result. If you use it, I take no responsibility, I&rsquo;m not a programmer.<br />
Ruby is pretty slick, I think I may actually try and use it and learn it a little better.</p>
