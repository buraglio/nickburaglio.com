			<p><a href="http://www.engadgetmobile.com/2007/02/16/iphone-to-run-300-400-after-contract/">Some stuff as leaked</a> about the pricing of the iPhone from apple to be launched by Cingular/AT&amp;T in the next few months. Surprisingly (to me at least) the prices were $200 lower than was expected. I&rsquo;m still ion the fence about switching to Cingular and gettin an iPhone. I like the idea of Rollover, and I love the idea of having a SIM in my phone. On the other hand, I have been relatively happy with Verizon for a few years and I don&rsquo;t think I can give up the calendar or functions my Treo offers.<br />
We all should have such problems&hellip;..</p>
