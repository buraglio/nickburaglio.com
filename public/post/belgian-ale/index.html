			<p>I made a Belgian ale this weekend, I had most of the ingredients here already, including a good WL Belgian Ale Yeast blend. It&rsquo;s currently fermenting away nicely</p>

<p>The recipe can be found <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/brew/recipes/Buraglio_s_Belgian_Ale.html">here</a> or <a href="http://docs.google.com/a/buraglio.com/Doc?id=dg6p466h_32dgpbp4f6">here</a> for the google document version (it will update as I add notes).</p>
