			<p>As I have done every year (save one) since its inception, I headed over to the <a href="http://www.jaytv.com/urbanabeerandchili/">annual Urbana Beer and Chili cook off in Downtown Urbana</a>. My expectations are never really high because of the usual things that go along with running such an event in a college town. It is promoted by <a href="http://www.jaytv.com/">Jay Goldberg Events</a>, the owners of the <a href="http://">canopy club</a> if I understand correctly. It is more or less worked by volunteers who know little to nothing about the beverages they are serving, but there is a decent selection (I believe all coming from Premium Brands distributor). It has been held in the parking garage in downtown Urbana for the last few years and, although it was a beautiful day, I got fairly sunburned waiting in line, which brings me to one of my major gripes about this event.<br />
I like to buy tickets in advance. One has to pay a &ldquo;convenience fee&rdquo; if they purchase online. The fee plus the ticket amounts to more than if I were to buy the tickets at the door. Fine. They need to cover some kind of costs for providing stuff online. I can accept that. I can also accept that every year I get there early and STILL never get the tasting glass that they offer to the first <em>N</em> people that arrive. The tasting glass issue was remedied this year, I got my first one ever. I was pleased about that.<br />
The other fairly significant issue is that they either<br />
A. Don&rsquo;t have many chili options<br />
B. The chili runs out before everyone gets inside<br />
or<br />
C. both</p>

<p>This year that was surprisingly different. Actually, this year the chili was more satisfying than the beer for me. Don&rsquo;t ge tme wring, the beer was great but there were only a few things that I&rsquo;d never had before. Most notably, there was a pretty good <a href="http://www.wyders.com/productdescriptions.htm">pear cider</a> that I&rsquo;d never had and several other belgian ales that I&rsquo;d always been too cheap to buy a bottle of myself. Other than that everything else was either old hat for me or just not my style.<br />
Overall I&rsquo;d have to say that even though the organization and execution of the event is criminally inefficient, it&rsquo;s still a &ldquo;should do&rdquo; in and around the Champaign-Urbana area.<br />
A few things that you can expect if you&rsquo;ve never been before:<br />
A very long line to get in if you get there early.<br />
They won&rsquo;t let you in on time. Expect to get in at the earliest 20 minutes after the flyers say it will start.<br />
Chili has been hit or miss in the past (although I&rsquo;d give them an A for chili this year (2008)<br />
Chili will run out way before the beer<br />
All of the beers on the list will not be available<br />
It&rsquo;ll be crowded<br />
It&rsquo;ll likely be fun if you like to taste beer.<br />
It&rsquo;s the only event of its kind in the area so you might as well at least check it out.</p>

<p>Some things to look out for:<br />
MAKE SURE to hit up the <a href="https://netfiles.uiuc.edu/ro/www/BoneyardUnionofZymurgicalZealots/">local home brew club</a> table. It&rsquo;s probably going to be the best beer at the place.<br />
Hit up the tables with the &ldquo;$1&rdquo; or &ldquo;two ticket&rdquo; tastings. They have the more unique and, in my opinion, better tastings.</p>
