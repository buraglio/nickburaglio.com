			<p>I&rsquo;m frustrated. I really love my iphone. I&rsquo;ve had one since the beginning, but I am feeling a bit of device envy for some of those &ldquo;other&rdquo; phones out there. I really like that I am basically carrying a unix box around in my pocket, and that I can install apps and sync calendars and contacts and send and receive email&hellip;..and that it all works seamlessly from my mac.<br />
Many of those things are actually pretty straightforward and widely available&hellip;..if you have a PC. Now, RIM has released the new mac Blackberry app, and it works pretty well&hellip;it&rsquo;s like 2002 for mac users with blackberries!<br />
This is the niche that the iPhone filled.<br />
Unfortunately, all of the politics and apple-ness has also come with that nice package. They want to control the user experience, and for the most part they do a fantastic job of it. I&rsquo;ve always been a big apple fan, even when their OS sucked (and how; remember OS7?), but I&rsquo;m also a control freak. I want to be able to tweak&hellip;.without violating some arbitrary user agreement.<br />
I want to be able to run the apps that I want to run, not what some carrier or some hardware company wants me to run. So, to that end, I will be considering all other devices that can perform similarly when the time is here to upgrade.</p>

<p>Lets go over a few things.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.weeklyreader.com/readandwriting/content/binary/iphone.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Here are the things that I am looking for:</p>

<p>Media support of mp3, video, audiobook<br />
Full mac support for adding media (music, video, audiobooks)<br />
Support for secure syncing of contacts (via either mac or OTA)<br />
Support for secure syncing calendar OTA.<br />
Secure email support of more than 2 accounts (activesync or imap).<br />
Ability to install all available apps [easily, without a hack].<br />
Unix based operating system<br />
802.11g wifi<br />
3g cellular support<br />
&gt;=2.0mp camera<br />
ability to lock screen with code<br />
video recording capability</p>

<p>Extra points for:<br />
Supporting my existing provider (AT&amp;T)<br />
expandable memory<br />
user replaceable battery<br />
*<strong>not</strong>* having to jailbreak or hack device to unsupported state to accomplish all requirements</p>

<p>So far the contenders are:<br />
Nokia n900<br />
Motorola Droid<br />
Palm pre<br />
LG eve(?)<br />
SE Xperia X10(?)</p>

<p>Does anyone else have any suggestions?</p>
