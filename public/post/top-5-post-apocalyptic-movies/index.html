A talking dog, Don Johnson and a drive to get laid.  This one is funky and cheesy but totally list worthy. 2. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075909/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Damnation Alley</a>.  If you&rsquo;ve not seen this, find it and watch it.  It&rsquo;s campy and cheesy but amazing at the same time.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001821/?ref_=tt_ov_st">Jan-Michael Vincent</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000577/?ref_=tt_ov_st">George Peppard</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0761212/?ref_=tt_ov_st">Dominique Sanda</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0355097/">Jackie Earle Haley</a>, giant cockroaches and a badass vehicle.  I always wanted a toy of that truck. <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/snake-plissken-jacket.jpg"><img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/snake-plissken-jacket.jpg" alt="snake-plissken-jacket" /></a>2. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082340/">Escape from New York</a>. This one was <strong>very</strong> close to being #1 on my list.  Once I got drunk and drew the snake tattoo on myself.  This movie is amazing in every way. I often ask myself  &rdquo;What would Snake Plissken do?&rdquo; and take that into advisement.  It&rsquo;s 1980&rsquo;s cheese but fantastic at the same time.  The sequel was a pile of crap and as far as I&rsquo;m concerned does not exist.       <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/roadwarrior1.jpg"><img src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/roadwarrior1-300x197.jpg" alt="roadwarrior1" /></a> 1. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082694/">The Road Warrior</a>. The Second of the &ldquo;Mad Max&rdquo; trilogy.  Probably the first of this style that I ever saw.  Also my favorite.  Max is the tortured hero that somehow kinda does the right thing but it no one to be trifled with.  Watch this with commentary on for a really interesting take, but if you&rsquo;ve never seen it, watch it undisturbed first.  Great movie, I can watch it over and over.       Honorable mentions: <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1037705/">The Book of Eli</a>.  I&rsquo;m not a Denzel fan.  At all.  I had almost zero expectation of this movie.  I was very surprised and entertained and actually went back and watched it a second time to make sure it was not a fluke of some kind.  Even given the religious overtones, which I also generally don&rsquo;t like, I enjoyed this movie. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089530/?ref_=sr_1">Mad Max beyond Thunderdome</a>.  Also great.  Now that I&rsquo;m writing this, I may choose to replace Shawn of the dead with this flick.  I actually saw this one before the road warrior as a kid, but that didn&rsquo;t change it at all, once I saw the road warrior I rode my bicycle to the video store and rented this for another go.  It just made it better.  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0026353/?ref_=tt_cl_t8">Angry Anderson</a> is the subtle star as &ldquo;IronBar&rdquo;. I have a huge list of more that I need to watch and re-watch, so this list will probably change.  In particular, I want to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118736/">Six-String Samurai</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056119/?ref_=sr_1">La Jatee</a> and a handful of others I was not familiar with.</p>
