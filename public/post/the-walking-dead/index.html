			<p>I saw this over at my <a href="http://mike.buraglio.com/2010/10/walking-dead-trailer.html">brother&rsquo;s blog</a>, and it looks pretty amazing. I&rsquo;m a really big fan of zombie and post-apocalyptic stuff and this appears to have high potential. I&rsquo;ve not read the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Walking-Dead-Graphic-Novel-Collection/lm/R3DLKI0S20B6L6">graphic novels</a> (although I will be obtaining it and reading it before the premiere), but if Mike says it&rsquo;s good, it probably is.<br />
AMC has been pumping out some really good stuff, lets hope this lives up to the trailer.</p>
