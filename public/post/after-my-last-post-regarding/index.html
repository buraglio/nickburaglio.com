			<p>After my last post regarding my treo I started looking into why certain apps were failing or whatever, specifically <a href="http://www.rmrsoft.com/palm/diet.htm">rmrdiet</a>. Others were using this app on a treo 650 and it claims support. I reinstalled it to RAM (as opposed to my memory card) and it&rsquo;s working very well now. This really is a powerful app for $20 (although I have still not paid). It seems to just give the nag screen and not a requirement for registration. My only gripe is that I can&rsquo;t figure out how to add different calorie burning activities. I don&rsquo;t use a windows machine so I have not tested the windows app to see if thats needed. Once I figure that out I&rsquo;ll happpily give them my $20. If you&rsquo;re looking for something that tracks calories, fat, cholesterol, excercise / activities etc, I think I can safely recommend <a href="http://www.rmrsoft.com/palm/diet.htm">rmrdiet</a>. I&rsquo;m going to try putting it back on my SD card and see if it crashes&hellip;</p>
