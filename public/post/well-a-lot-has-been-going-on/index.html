			<p>A lot has been going on. I&rsquo;ve been to Aruba on vacation and to Canada for a <a href="http://www.bsdcan.org/">great conference</a>. Summer is here and I&rsquo;m gearing up for the <a href="https://msillinois.org/">MS150</a>&hellip;..It looks like we&rsquo;re sticking around Champaign for a while longer, but life&rsquo;s about to get a little more interesting&hellip;&hellip;..</p>
