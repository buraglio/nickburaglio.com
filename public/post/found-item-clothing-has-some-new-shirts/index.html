			<p>I&rsquo;ve long been a fan of <a href="http://www.founditemclothing.com/">Found Item Clothing</a>, they have some really obscure shirts that aren&rsquo;t found elsewhere and are pretty diligent about reproducing them as closely to the original as possible. I have several of their shirts and have always been very happy with both the quality and the service.<br />
In keeping with their tradition of finding cool ideas from (often underrated) 80&rsquo;s movies, they&rsquo;ve introduced the <a href="http://www.founditemclothing.com/t-shirts/death-before-disco-shirt.html">&ldquo;Death Before Disco&rdquo;</a> sweatshirt from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083131/">Stripes</a>. <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083131/">Stripes</a> is one of my favorite movies from my youth (along with most other <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000195/">Bill Murray</a> comedies).</p>

<p><img src="http://www.founditemclothing.com/t-shirts/gfx/death-before-disco/death-before-disco-sweatshirt-lg.jpg" alt="Death Before Disco!" /></p>

<p>I will very likely be ordering this or requesting it for xmas.</p>
