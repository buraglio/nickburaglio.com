			<p>As many know, I love T-Shirts, and the only thing better than a great T-Shirt, is a great shirt from a classic 80&rsquo;s movie of my childhood.<br />
Thank goodness there is <a href="http://founditemclothing.com/">Found Item Clothing</a>. These guys recreate so many of the shirts from classic pop culture and just all around great movies (they also have a pretty good <a href="http://www.founditemclothing.com/itgoesto11/index.php">movie/dvd review section</a>).<br />
Anyway, in keeping with their awesome tradition, they&rsquo;ve released even more new <a href="http://founditemclothing.com/t-shirt-menu.html">shirts</a>. I mean, come on, where else are you going to find the shirt that <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0011933/">Jack Burton</a> wore in <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090728/">Big Trouble in Little China</a> or the <a href="http://founditemclothing.com/t-shirts/spinal-tap-skeleton-shirt.html">Skeleton shirt</a> from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088258/">This is Spinal Tap</a> pains takingly recreated in every detail?</p>

<p>Hell, I got the <a href="http://www.bunnyslippers.com/bunny-slippers/classic-bunny-slippers.php">Bunny Slippers</a> from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089886/">Real Genius</a> for my wife last year for xmas.</p>
