			<p>We went down to Clinton tonight to see some family and take care of some stuff. We decided to make an evening of it and wanted to head back to Sergio&rsquo;s for dinner.<br />

This place is one of the best kept secrets of my home town of Clinton, IL. Sergio&rsquo;s mexican restaraunt has the absolutely undisputed best burritos i&rsquo;ve ever had. Their $4.85 burrito is the size of a labamba super and their $9 burrito&hellip;.well it needs it&rsquo;s own zip code. I&rsquo;d seriously be surprised if it weighed less than 5lbs. Plan on eating it for more than one meal. If you ever get the chance, stop by there. you won&rsquo;t regret it. They&rsquo;re open 10am to 10pm tues - sat. <img src="http://buraglio.com/nick/images/sergiosburrito.jpg" alt="" /><br />
Above is a pic I snapped with my treo, it&rsquo;s of the regular ($4.85) chicken burrito. I had a hard time finishing it. I&rsquo;ve only seen a $9 on one occasion, it was frighteningly heavy and a huge burrito.</p>
