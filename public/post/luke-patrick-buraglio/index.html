			<p>In keeping with tradition, Luke decided to make a grand entrance after much drama at 0627 on December 30, 2008, weighing in at a svelte 6lb 10.7oz and 21&rdquo; in length. Both Luke and his strong, resilient mother are doing exceptionally well. There have been a lot of friends and family swinging by to visit, with more to come.</p>
