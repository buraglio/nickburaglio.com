What is it about today? So many posts! (I had some free time). It&rsquo;s a widely known fact that I love T-Shirts. I have a fairly extensive collections that contains shirts that I&rsquo;ve had for half of my life (yeah, I have 15 year old T-Shirts, what of it?!?) I have always wanted to start a T-Shirt company, not for profit so much as for fun. This may become a reality, but thats a story for another time. I was looking for something fun and found 3 pretty good places online to get shirts. <a href="http://www.bustedtees.com/">BustedTees.com</a> has some awesome shirts, I particularly like the &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; shirt (referenced from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/">The Big Lebowski</a>, which is a must own IMO). <a href="http://www.brewcityonline.com/">Brew City Online</a> has some great beer related shirts, I recommend picking one up. But the mother load of them all HAS to be <a href="http://www.founditemclothing.com/">Found Item Clothing</a>. This guy has followed every detail on some CLASSIC shirts. I have ordered a few from him and he always ships promptly and the product is exactly as described. I strive to have all the ones he makes, since they are all classics in my book.</p>
