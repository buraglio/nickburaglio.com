<p>I recently replaced my aging (and now scratched) Ray Ban sunglasses (RB 4009) with a pair of New Ray Ban Predator <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001UQ71N2?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=nickburaglioc-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B001UQ71N2">Ray Ban RB4026</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=nickburaglioc-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B001UQ71N2" alt="" /><br />
series. The old ones had served me well (purchased in 2004; a replacement of my early 1990&rsquo;s pair of the same style) but they&rsquo;d recently been dropped and the lenses scratched pretty severely. So, how did I usher in the new pair? By dropping them like 4 hours after I bought them. Luckily no scratched lenses on the new pair so far&hellip;</p>
