Even thought I just bought a new one, I really like the idea of not using a car, but instead being able to do day-to-day stuff on a bicycle. There are several reasons I feel this way, the first being that I strongly dislike being in a car. It&rsquo;s not that comfortable (yes, I&rsquo;m even talking about luxury cars), they&rsquo;re expensive, gas prices are out-freakin-rageous, and the excercise you get on a bike is good for you. Not to mention it&rsquo;s better for the environment.<br />
I ride my bike to work whenever weather permits, I think more people should do the same. I think that the guys over at <a href="http://www.xtracycle.com/">Xtracycle</a> have a novel idea. An SUB, sport utility bicycle. They&rsquo;re ugly, but they look like they could work well for for carrying around day-to-day stuff.</p>
