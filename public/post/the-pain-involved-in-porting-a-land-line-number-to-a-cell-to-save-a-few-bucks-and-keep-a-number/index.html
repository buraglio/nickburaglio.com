<p>Where to actually start on this&hellip;&hellip;.<br />
Since the availability of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_number_portability">LNP (Local Number Portability)</a> I&rsquo;ve contemplated moving our landline number that has been in place for about 10 years to a family share type of line on our cell plan.<br />
Why, you may ask, would one even bother to keep a land line in this day and age other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E911">e911 service</a> or a DSL or other data service line that requires it? History. We have had this number for so long that it would be almost more trouble to get rid of it.<br />

Certain people don&rsquo;t like to call cell numbers, certain people have it programmed into their phones, etc, etc, etc. The list goes on and on. A few other reasons that are of note are the fact that some people just don&rsquo;t like talking on a cell phone. A &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; handset is far more ergonomic, doesn&rsquo;t get hot in use and can be easily extended to multiple handsets.<br />
<strong>But wait! VoIP! VoIP!</strong> Yeah&hellip;..read the fine print. I&rsquo;ve deployed VoiP before in a small enterprise, I know the things that can *not* work with VoIP, and the fact that it&rsquo;s not technically classified as phone service by the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a> can sometimes (but not always) make it painful to get a ported number out of there should you want to move to a new service. I did strongly consider both <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> and <a href="http://www.broadvoice.com/">Broadvoice</a> but ultimately decided against it after discovering the aforementioned details and, more importantly, Comcast took over my are for my data service and it became &ldquo;comcastic&rdquo; (translated, less reliable). Cable VoIP is an option in my area as well but the price point isn&rsquo;t much better than a traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POTS">POTS</a> line.<br />
So we&rsquo;re back to a cell line. Why not, I have thousands of rollover minutes and they are just going to waste in their current state.<br />
At this point I was ready to bite the bullet and try it out. I have existing service with AT&amp;T and am relatively happy with it so I figured, what the heck, now I need to find a way to make it work with a friendlier handset.<br />
There are many, many options for this at this stage in the game. I looked at pretty much all of them that I could find. I read the reviews, tested a few out and ultimately ended up with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dect-6-0-Cellfusion-Caller-Jack/dp/B001ACXI6U/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1227159254&amp;sr=1-9">Dect 6.0 Cellfusion Caller Id 2HS No Jack</a>. The only shortcoming I found is the lack of an answering machine, but the cell voicemail should cover that, or so I thought at the time. As an aside, they do offer a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thomson-28128EE2-Cell-Fusion-Dual/dp/B000NWEJK2">Cell fusion with an answering machine</a> but the extra money turned me back to the original. Both are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECT">DECT</a> systems which, in theory, means less interference.<br />
Voicemail was still an issue, since I don&rsquo;t want to have to check the actual cell device to see if there is a message waiting for me. A visual or auditory indicator would be optimal. I couldn&rsquo;t really figure out an elegant way to do this, so I&rsquo;ve opted to try forwarding unanswered calls to <a href="http://www.youmail.com/">youmail</a>, which i thought would update the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Waiting_Indicator">WMI</a>on the phone system I bought, but it only seems to be able to update the MWI on the cell&hellip;bummer. Option hack #2 was to still use youmail and have it send an &ldquo;email&rdquo; to a special &ldquo;mailing list&rdquo; I create that has my and my wife&rsquo;s Email to TXT/SMS addresses as members so we&rsquo;d just get a txt message to each of our regular cell phones and check it from there. &hellip;..it&rsquo;s a hack, I know. I have a feeling that I&rsquo;ll be returning the original phone system and getting the one with the answering machine since there are so many dependencies in my current methodology.</p>

<p><strong>To the port.</strong><br />
Well this, I thought, would be pretty straight forward. I&rsquo;ve ported cell numbers a few times and it&rsquo;s always been really painless and respectably quick. No. It&rsquo;s not the same as porting a cell number. I needed all of the things you&rsquo;d expect, the account number, SS# of the account holder (and the account holder available, since it was in my wife&rsquo;s name) as well as (and this is the part that I didn&rsquo;t know about), I needed to remove all the services off of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POTS">POTS</a> line. Blech. So many steps. After removing all services off of the POTS line (which, by the way, is amazing to watch since you get SO used to things like caller ID) I called back.<br />
Port underway. 7-10 business days. A deep sigh. OK, I&rsquo;ll wait it out. After 2 days the port was &ldquo;approved&rdquo; (I found this out by calling the AT&amp;T port center @ 1-188-895-1097), it asked me to enter some information and finish it. Fantastic. I enter the information and it throws some error and drops me to a person. They can&rsquo;t find the number and after searching for a few seconds let me know that there is a &ldquo;due date&rdquo; of 3 days from now at 11pm. No problem, that is still not <em>that</em> long. I&rsquo;ll wait it out.</p>

<p>After a few more days of waiting and 2 more short calls to AT&amp;T (one when they were closed), the number is now ported in. The port was very easy once the approval process was done and the time had elapsed.<br />
I opted to forward my number to <a href="http://grandcentral.com/">GrandCentral</a> to start off with, they have more options as far as forwarding and screening calls so I figured I&rsquo;d try them first.<br />
I still have a feeling I may be getting the cell fusion phone system with the answering machine, but the band-aid has been ripped off at this point; the hard part is done.</p>

<p>Back out plans are in place, if the service is just awful I still have almost 3 weeks to back out, return the cell line and port my number back in, hopefully without a reconnect fee since we would be considered a &ldquo;win back&rdquo; customer.</p>

<p>Only time will tell. Let the testing begin.</p>
