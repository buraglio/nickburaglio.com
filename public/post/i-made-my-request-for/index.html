			<p>I made my request for a Verizon Treo 650 this week to replace my beat up Treo 600. After much researach and reading I came to the following accessories:</p>

<p>Plantronics Voyager 510 headset: <a href="http://tinyurl.com/9zq79">$52.24</a></p>

<p>Spare Battery TRE650BAT $29.99<br />
Car Charger TRE650VPC $22.49<br />
Spec Skintight Holster <a href="http://tinyurl.com/am8r2">$34.95</a><br />
Screen protectors <a href="http://tinyurl.com/9e7pe">$15.95</a></p>

<p>These were heavily influenced by stuff I&rsquo;ve seen other people with as well as reviews on <a href="http://blog.treonauts.com/">Treonauts</a><br />
I find this device, while a little large for my tastes, to be invaluable. I hate having a lot of crap with me but I need the functions of an organizer and the fact that there is decent speed internet access (1xRTT; roughly 144k) and a wealth of net apps that take advante of the net and even more that are just plain useful make it a &ldquo;must consider&rdquo; device for someone that needs help organizing themselves or just someone that likes gadgets.<br />
Here are some useful apps to wet your palet:</p>

<p><a href="http://mytreo.net/downloads/details-640.html?KeyguardTime%2B">KeyGTime+</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.geekandproud.net/software/keycaps650.php">KeyCaps600 (and 650)</a> KeyCaps650 lets you set your keys to generate capital letters when pressing twice (among other things).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.kwik.cz/palm/treo/profiles/">Profiles</a> Lets you control volume, color, brightness, keyguard, bean receive, and many more things.</p>

<p>A pretty good list of starter apps can be found <a href="http://www.howardforums.com/archive/topic/629970-1.html">here</a>.</p>
