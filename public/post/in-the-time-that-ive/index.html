			<p>In the time that I&rsquo;ve been (what I would describe as) an IT professional, lets say, &gt;5 years and Why can&rsquo;t I find a filtering system that does everythiung I need and want?<br />
I love the packet mangling, QoS, traffic shaping, whatever you want to call it today. I can&rsquo;t use an internet cnnection without it. I NEED my ssh connections to be fast and not lagging. I WANT my surfing and email checking to be zippy and snappy. I also may want to cvsup or ftp the newest ISO of FreeBSD at the same time.<br />
I&rsquo;d LOVE to have the ability to use PF under FreeBSD with it&rsquo;s beautiful syntax and ease of use. It&rsquo;s like the Lamborghini of filtering. Elegant, powerful, fast. I also want to be able to do things like filter or QoS based on pattern matching or block stuff local to certain interfaces via MAC address. I want to be able to NAT OR bridge and have all the functionality in both function. Maybe it&rsquo;s a pipe dream. I really like some of the abilities of netfilter. Blocking via MAC is great for something like an apartment complex on a college campus as is filtering via pattern matching. Linux has all of these features&hellip;&hellip;but then I&rsquo;d have to use Linux&hellip;..<br />
Some may say that that may not be a bad thing. I don&rsquo;t necessarily disagree.<br />
Maybe thats why I feel linux is too clunky compared to the seemingly streamlined sleekness of a BSD. All the cool features weighting it down? Maybe.<br />
Are there holes in my ideas, of course. The smarter of the users could always clone a MAC. Thats a simple workaround for MAC based filtering, BUT, 90% of users aren&rsquo;t going to know how.<br />
Pattern matching on packets for filtering, yes, I agree that it *should* be done by a proxy. After all, that is what a proxy is supposed to do. But look at the <a href="http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/">L7 filter project</a>. It works pretty well if one understands <a href="http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/L7-HOWTO-Netfilter#Intro">what it can and can&rsquo;t do.</a><br />
I fully realize that PF is a layer 3 product&hellip;&hellip;.but so many others have broadened their scope to include useful features like this. Maybe this is why PF is so powerful and clean, I don&rsquo;t know. Could it be that it is because it doesn&rsquo;t try to be everything to everyone? Probably. I can always speculate.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d love to see an independent PF based add-on project like the <a href="http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/">l7 filter</a>. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m nowhere near at the programming level to even think about attempting it myself.<br />
If you know of one, please <a href="mailto:nick+blog@buraglio.com?subject=Regarding%20your%20blog%20post%20on%20L7%20PF%20and%20MAC%20filtering">email me</a>.</p>

<p>I know, I can want in one hand and take a dump in the other and see which one fills up first..</p>
