			<p>I started trying to make some packages for the <a href="http://www.pfsense.org/">pfsense</a> platform. I&rsquo;mnot really a developer and don&rsquo;t know xml or php so I&rsquo;m using this as an excuse to learn. My first attempt is with pftabled, a very useful c program for free and openbsd for manipulating pf tables remotely. First pass is available <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/projects/pfsense/pftabled.tgz">here</a></p>
