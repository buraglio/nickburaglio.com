			<p>I&rsquo;ve been making <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead">mead</a> as long as I&rsquo;ve been making beer, and frankly, mead is much easier. I&rsquo;m not a big wine drinker or really even a fan of wine, but mead is so easy to make and it turns out well with minimal work so I make it a few times a year. Here is a quick and dirty howto on making simple, traditional mead that I threw together a few nights ago: Mead is a good choice for those wanting to start with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zymurgy">zymology</a>, as it takes few ingredients and can be done on a budget. Mead is simple. Many folks, like in brewing, have a lot to say about checking this and that, boiling the must, etc. I choose to go very basic, start with a base mead and then add fruit later. If you&rsquo;re interested in making mead and want some quick mead recipes or just general information, check out <a href="http://www.gotmead.com/">gotmead.com</a>, they have links and a wealth of information on the subject.</p>
