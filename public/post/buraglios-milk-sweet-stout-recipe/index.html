			<p>Since many folks have asked for this recipe, I decided that I should actually go and copy it from my notes to my Google Docs archhive of recipes.</p>

<p>This beer was a bit of a surprise, I made it with some pretty old ingredients a little last minute and didn&rsquo;t expect much from it.  I pitched it onto an existing yeast cake from my vanilla porter and just let it go.  It was the 3rd batch I&rsquo;d ever done and, boy, it turned out GREAT.  I still think this is the best brew I&rsquo;ve ever made.  I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever be able to *truly* recreate it&rsquo;s uniqueness in origin but I will certainly be making another batch of this in the next few months.</p>

<p>A link to the Google Document can be found<a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg6p466h_33fh56k2dv">here</a>, or a local copy can be found <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/brew/recipes/11_28_2007_Sweet_Milk_S.html">here in my brew archive</a>.</p>

<p>This is a good one. If you like a good sweet stout then by all means make a batch of this.</p>
