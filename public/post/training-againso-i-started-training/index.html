<h3 id="training-again">training again</h3>

<p>So I started training again after a month and a half of on-again off-again training and boy does it go quickly as you get older. The submission wrestling and cycling cardio are quick to slip away. Having been wrestling now for about 2 weeks (at 2 times a week, I&rsquo;m not yet up to 4 again) I thought the cardio was a little better, but alas, as I hit the cycle at the gym this morning I was rudely awakened by tired legs and sucking wind. I&rsquo;d really like to get a training rig and some mats for my basement but have not had the time or motivation to properly research it.</p>
