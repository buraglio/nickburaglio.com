<p>I&rsquo;d never had (or heard of) a Maibock before I saw this. Billed as &ldquo;munich&rsquo;s first maibock&rdquo;, this was a sweet carmel tasting beer, historically enjoyed in the springtime in germany. A decent punch but I&rsquo;m not sure of the alc. content in this $2.99 pint bottle. I&rsquo;d not had any food when I enjoyed it and was left with a little buzz. A dark carmel color with very little head, it was a good drink. I&rsquo;d recommend trying one if presented with the opportunity.</p>
