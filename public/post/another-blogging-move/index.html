			<p>My Blogging has come full circle.  I had originally investigated CMS/WYSIWYG type blogging years ago using blogger.  After about a year I moved it to my own self hosted service using newsbruiser, then to movable type, and finally to a self hosted wordpress instance.<br />
Well, I&rsquo;m moving all of my web hosting away from my colocated server and to other locations.  For my own stuff, I&rsquo;ve move all of it back to blogger using a custom domain.<br />
So far, so good.  All data imported, custom redirects (via apache on my ArpNetworks VPS) all working.  Custom domains up and running.  Google has really done a good job with the ghs adoption into blogger.<br />
Now I just need to get my twitter feed integrated and images moved in and I should be good to go.<br />
Hopefully it can stay here for years to come.</p>
