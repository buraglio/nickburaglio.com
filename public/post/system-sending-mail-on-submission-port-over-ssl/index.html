			<p>I have a few cron jobs that run on my home mac machines and I like to get the notifications generated from the MAILTO parameter. Well, a while ago (I believe after the comcast acquisition of insightbb), this stopped working. I did a little debugging and it is my belief that <a href="http://www.pdxtc.com/wpblog/technology-articles/cant-send-mail-using-comcast/">port 25 is being blocked outbound from the comcast network</a>. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=comcast+blocking+port+25&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;aq=t&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&amp;client=firefox-a">Many people speculate</a>this, and as a network engineer I think it is actually a good idea. First, port 25 isn&rsquo;t <em>*<strong>really</strong>*</em> the port that you should be using for host to mail relay. I was always taught that the <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2476.html">submission port</a> was best practice per <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2476.html">RFC 2476</a> . In practice, many folks don&rsquo;t use this port simply because since as far back as I can remember documentation has always pointed end users at port 25.<br />
So, long story short, something I wanted to do for a long time was to set up a special account under my <a href="http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html">google apps</a> that can be used to relay and record this data, as well as be used for things like an email wild card for my domain.<br />
I was about to embark on hacking up the postfix installs then I came across <a href="http://www.macosxhints.com/article.php?story=20081217161612647">this macosxhints article</a>.<br />
It&rsquo;s a very handy walk through of doing exactly what I wanted to do, relay mail on port 587, over ssl through my ISP to an externally hosted email account.<br />
Very handy.</p>
