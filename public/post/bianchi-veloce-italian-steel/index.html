Well, I finally got the new road bike that I had been selling all my stuff off to get. It was a long process, dealing with Bianchi sending the wrong bike, Bikeworks getting enough time to assemble it, getting it home, getting clipless shoes (expensive!!) etc, etc. But it&rsquo;s finally here and I must say, it&rsquo;s FAST. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I love my <a href="http://buraglio.com/pics/bikes/Trek7300FX/tn/Photo_051406_002.jpg.html">Trek 7300FX</a>, I ride it to work whenever weather and work permits, but this is a road bike, and it&rsquo;s quite a different experience. It&rsquo;s almost like comparing apples to oranges, they&rsquo;re both fruit but too different to compare. I have had it a week as of today and the weather has been crummy since the day after I got it so I&rsquo;ve only been on two short rides, but WOW! The clipless pedals make a HUGE difference. The carbon fork and slick <a href="http://www.campagnolo.com/">campagnolo</a> components don&rsquo;t hurt either. I can&rsquo;t wait to take this puppy on a 30+ mile run. I was hoping to ride from Champaign to Clinton tomorrow but the weather doesn&rsquo;t look like it&rsquo;ll permit. Maybe next weekend.</p>
