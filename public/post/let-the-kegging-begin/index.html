			<p>I got my keg order in and it looks like I can fit 2 kegs plus a co2 dispenser in the beer fridge. The local homebrew club got such a great deal on the kegs that I decided to put off switching to all grain and spend the money on a kegging system. I was able to get five used 5 gallon kegs plus new seals for $80 through our local club (we did a huge order).<br />

<p>I&rsquo;m pretty excited. I think I&rsquo;ll put my oktoberfest in there if I can get the co2 in time.</p>

<p>Let the kegging begin!</p>
