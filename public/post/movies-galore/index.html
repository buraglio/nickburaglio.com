			<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of movies and film.  I have a minor in film studies from Illinois State University and did (sometimes still do) a bit of video art.  I&rsquo;ve embraced the technology at this point and use Netflix quite a bit and watch movies as I get time.</p>

<p>I have a fairly extensive DVD (and now Blue Ray) collection as well.<br />
Here you can find the top few movies off of my Netflix queue.</p>

<p>There are going to be some kids movies on there now as well =)</p>
