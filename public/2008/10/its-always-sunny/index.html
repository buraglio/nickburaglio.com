			<p>I happen to love <a href="http://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/originals/sunny/#/home/">It&rsquo;s always sunny in Philadelphia</a>.<br />
I find it&rsquo;s lack of tact and willingness to push the envelope of good taste refreshing. In fact, one of their recent episodes (who pooped the bed) has a striking similarity to a funny story from my college days when we told everyone that Carl pooped the bed (which he really didn&rsquo;t, but damn was it funny).</p>

<p>The strange pop culture references like mac wanting to be a cooler (like from Roadhouse) is downright genius and the physical humor is pretty darned good too.</p>

<p>Everyone should watch this show if for no other reason than to enjoy the references. Charlie is freakin&rsquo; hilarious and I want a <a href="http://www.begreenman.com/">Green man costume</a>.<br />
I have an awesome idea for an episode, maybe I&rsquo;ll send it in. These guys are probably crazy enough to do it.</p>
