<p>I&rsquo;ve been revisiting IPv6 a lot again lately, and one thing I wanted to do was to get my home network back running IPv6 again after having it off for a while. IPv6 isn&rsquo;t that hard to understand, configure, route or use, it&rsquo;s just different and I need to know it well for my job so this is a good excuse to play around and re-read some of the books I bought years ago on the subject.<br />
Since my lovely provider, Comcast, has no plan to deploy v6 yet I turned to one of the several <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FList_of_IPv6_tunnel_brokers&amp;ei=ZuNJScryGpzaMPvBpewE&amp;usg=AFQjCNFs8wXSQavbjyi6SKBC-LsOuqJs9g&amp;sig2=slUWlxyTaEd7m1GDmDMjKg">IPv6 Tunnel Brokers</a>. I had used the <a href="http://www.tunnelbroker.com/">Hurricane Electric Tunnel Broker</a> service a lot when first pawing at v6 years ago, and my tunnel info was still there.<br />
OK, Tunnel up. Reverse DNS delegated and working. Router Advertisements flying all over the network and <a href="http://www.tcpipguide.com/free/t_IPv6InterfaceIdentifiersandPhysicalAddressMapping-2.htm">modified EUI-64</a> addresses all looking good.<br />

<p>&hellip;..Flash back like 12 months. In an effort to be a little more conscious of money as well as environment, and out of good old fashioned cheapness, I took down my nice rack of servers, powered them all off, saved up my pennies and got a really nice <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/specs/">24&rdquo; iMac</a>, packed to the hilt with RAM and disk with the idea of using one of my copies of <a href="http://vmware.com/products/fusion/">vmware fusion</a> to run my <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>, <a href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD</a> and <a href="http://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> stuff on.</p>

<p>OK, time for the fun&hellip;..geting some v6 stuff to work through my network, over wireless, using vmware fusion with the gust OS in bridge mode&hellip;.uuuumm, nope.<br />
Hmmmm, why could this be? It&rsquo;s just a network interface, right? Wrong. After troubleshooting this for a while and seeing nothing in packet dumps from anything outside of the box I decided to hit up my the smartest place I know to look, <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> (yes, I used <a href="http://ipv6.google.com/">http://ipv6.google.com</a>).<br />
Low and behold, I found <a href="http://communities.vmware.com/thread/139716">this post</a>.</p>

<p>Apparently wireless interfaces are a problem, and as so tersely stated more than once in that thread &ldquo;VMware policy is to not comment on unannounced products, features, or timelines&rdquo;.<br />
Crud. Well, I&rsquo;m running vmware fusion 1.1.4 still&hellip;.maybe I&rsquo;ll see if it&rsquo;s supported in 2.0, but not tonight. That would make life too easy so I&rsquo;m not counting on it.</p>
