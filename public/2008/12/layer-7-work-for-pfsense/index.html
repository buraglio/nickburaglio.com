			<p>I&rsquo;m not really sure how I missed <a href="http://roadtoqos.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/the-layer7-interface/">this</a>, probably because it&rsquo;s some students doing the work, but nevertheless, it&rsquo;s very exciting.<br />
This is something that has been unavailable for the most part under *BSD, but <a href="http://l7-filter.sourceforge.net/">available for quite some time under Linux</a>. I personally don&rsquo;t like iptables and find it much less elegant than pf, both in implementation and practice so seeing this work is very encouraging and I can&rsquo;t wait to test it out.<br />
Adding this into <a href="http://pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> is a very exciting thing!</p>

<p>Add <a href="http://roadtoqos.wordpress.com/2008/11/27/the-layer7-interface/feed/">this blog</a> to your RSS reader to keep track!</p>

<p>BGP, QoS, L7, pf, CARP (and OSPF if I can get off my butt and finish the GUI), <a href="http://pfsense.org/">pfSense</a> is going to take over the world!</p>
