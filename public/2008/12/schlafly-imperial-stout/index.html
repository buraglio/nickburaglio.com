			<p>It&rsquo;s been quite a while since I did a beer review and I&rsquo;ve had SO many unique brews since the last one, but the most recent beverage I had worth writing about was the <a href="http://beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/583/33894">Schlafly Imperial Stout</a>. I was able to enjoy this the other night thanks to my brother-in-law Rob. I would highly recommend this big brew to anyone that has $ to drop in one big, dark, powerful beer. It&rsquo;s got some good undertones of bourbon with a little bite, but overall pretty silky.<br />
I like the Schlafly brewery and, since I&rsquo;m only about 2 and a half hours from St. Louis, I like to try their stuff and support a [kinda] local brewery.</p>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;d probably give it an A-/B+. I&rsquo;m not a huge imperial stout fan (and I&rsquo;m certainly too cheap to buy a bottle myself unless I&rsquo;d had a few beers first) but overall I really liked this brew.</p>
