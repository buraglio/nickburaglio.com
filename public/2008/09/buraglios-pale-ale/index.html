			<p>I decided it was finally time to brew one of my favorite styles for myself. I jumped in with both feet on this one, what I hope to be a VERY hoppy Pale Ale, which I&rsquo;ve so creatively titled &ldquo;Buraglio&rsquo;s Pale Ale&rdquo;.<br />
The recipe can be found on Google Documents <a href="http://docs.google.com/Doc?id=dg6p466h_35fr53bwc9">here</a>.<br />
Here is an image of it fermenting after 2 days. This was my first batch ever that actually needed a blow off tube rather than a simple airlock.</p>

<p>From the recipe you one can see that I added a lot of not only high IBU hops, but just a lot of hops in general.<br />
As an aside, I&rsquo;ve never used whole hop cones before (thanks to Kat Wefel for the hookup of her <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/v/Beers/Nugget-Hops.jpg.html">home grown Nugget hops</a>). They&rsquo;re a little different to deal with, needing to be strained before the move can be made to the primary fermentation vessel.<br />
I&rsquo;m still undecided regarding the dry hopping. I may wait for version 2 to give that a try or maybe I&rsquo;ll get ambitious, only time will tell.</p>
