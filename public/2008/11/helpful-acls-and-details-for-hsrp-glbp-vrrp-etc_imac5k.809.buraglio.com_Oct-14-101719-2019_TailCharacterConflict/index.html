			<p>Always being on the lookout for good, well put together information, I came across <a href="http://aconaway.com/2008/06/12/acls-and-hsrp-bgp-ospf-vrrp-glbp">this network oriented technical blog</a>, and it was a pretty helpful find, containing many of the ACLs and details for HSRP, BGP, OSPF, VRRP, GLBP. I posted a comment containing VRRP-E information.<br />
Anyone that has to deal with these protocols will likely find this a decent reference, and since they&rsquo;re all things that network engineers use all the time, it&rsquo;s nice to have them all in one place.<br />
I would suggest adding his <a href="http://aconaway.com/feed/">RSS Feed</a> to whatever your favorite RSS reader is. There is a lot of good information there and (unlike myself) the author seems pretty diligent about keeping it updated with <em>useful</em> information.</p>
