			<p><a href="http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/62041396/linux-here-we-come">That iPhone Dev team</a> has decided to port the linux kernel and <a href="http://www.busybox.net/">BusyBox</a>to the iPhone and write a completely new boot loader to support dual booting.</p>

<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/2373142">iPhone Linux Demonstration Video</a> from <a href="http://vimeo.com/user983560">planetbeing</a> on <a href="http://vimeo.com/">Vimeo</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure that it really means anything for everyday users of the iPhone at this point, but it&rsquo;s certainly interesting for geeks, hobbyists, code hackers and possibly developers.<br />
If I had a spare iPhone I might give it a whirl just to see it work, but since I don&rsquo;t I&rsquo;ll just be satisfied with the announcement.<br />
Any way you look at it&rsquo;s pretty nifty.</p>
