<p>Where to actually start on this&hellip;&hellip;.<br />
Since the availability of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_number_portability">LNP (Local Number Portability)</a> I&rsquo;ve contemplated moving our landline number that has been in place for about 10 years to a family share type of line on our cell plan.<br />
Why, you may ask, would one even bother to keep a land line in this day and age other than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E911">e911 service</a> or a DSL or other data service line that requires it? History. We have had this number for so long that it would be almost more trouble to get rid of it.<br />

Certain people don&rsquo;t like to call cell numbers, certain people have it programmed into their phones, etc, etc, etc. The list goes on and on. A few other reasons that are of note are the fact that some people just don&rsquo;t like talking on a cell phone. A &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; handset is far more ergonomic, doesn&rsquo;t get hot in use and can be easily extended to multiple handsets.<br />
<strong>But wait! VoIP! VoIP!</strong> Yeah&hellip;..read the fine print. I&rsquo;ve deployed VoiP before in a small enterprise, I know the things that can *not* work with VoIP, and the fact that it&rsquo;s not technically classified as phone service by the <a href="http://www.fcc.gov/">FCC</a> can sometimes (but not always) make it painful to get a ported number out of there should you want to move to a new service. I did strongly consider both <a href="http://www.vonage.com/">Vonage</a> and <a href="http://www.broadvoice.com/">Broadvoice</a> but ultimately decided against it after discovering the aforementioned details and, more importantly, Comcast took over my are for my data service and it became &ldquo;comcastic&rdquo; (translated, less reliable). Cable VoIP is an option in my area as well but the price point isn&rsquo;t much better than a traditional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POTS">POTS</a> line.<br />
So we&rsquo;re back to a cell line. Why not, I have thousands of rollover minutes and they are just going to waste in their current state.<br />
At this point I was ready to bite the bullet and try it out. I have existing service with AT&amp;T and am relatively happy with it so I figured, what the heck, now I need to find a way to make it work with a friendlier handset.<br />
There are many, many options for this at this stage in the game. I looked at pretty much all of them that I could find. I read the reviews, tested a few out and ultimately ended up with the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dect-6-0-Cellfusion-Caller-Jack/dp/B001ACXI6U/ref=sr_1_9?ie=UTF8&amp;s=electronics&amp;qid=1227159254&amp;sr=1-9">Dect 6.0 Cellfusion Caller Id 2HS No Jack</a>. The only shortcoming I found is the lack of an answering machine, but the cell voicemail should cover that, or so I thought at the time. As an aside, they do offer a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Thomson-28128EE2-Cell-Fusion-Dual/dp/B000NWEJK2">Cell fusion with an answering machine</a> but the extra money turned me back to the original. Both are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DECT">DECT</a> systems which, in theory, means less interference.<br />
Voicemail was still an issue, since I don&rsquo;t want to have to check the actual cell device to see if there is a message waiting for me. A visual or auditory indicator would be optimal. I couldn&rsquo;t really figure out an elegant way to do this, so I&rsquo;ve opted to try forwarding unanswered calls to <a href="http://www.youmail.com/">youmail</a>, which i thought would update the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Waiting_Indicator">WMI</a>on the phone system I bought, but it only seems to be able to update the MWI on the cell&hellip;bummer. Option hack #2 was to still use youmail and have it send an &ldquo;email&rdquo; to a special &ldquo;mailing list&rdquo; I create that has my and my wife&rsquo;s Email to TXT/SMS addresses as members so we&rsquo;d just get a txt message to each of our regular cell phones and check it from there. &hellip;..it&rsquo;s a hack, I know. I have a feeling that I&rsquo;ll be returning the original phone system and getting the one with the answering machine since there are so many dependencies in my current methodology.</p>

<p><strong>To the port.</strong><br />
Well this, I thought, would be pretty straight forward. I&rsquo;ve ported cell numbers a few times and it&rsquo;s always been really painless and respectably quick. No. It&rsquo;s not the same as porting a cell number. I needed all of the things you&rsquo;d expect, the account number, SS# of the account holder (and the account holder available, since it was in my wife&rsquo;s name) as well as (and this is the part that I didn&rsquo;t know about), I needed to remove all the services off of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POTS">POTS</a> line. Blech. So many steps. After removing all services off of the POTS line (which, by the way, is amazing to watch since you get SO used to things like caller ID) I called back.<br />
Port underway. 7-10 business days. A deep sigh. OK, I&rsquo;ll wait it out. After 2 days the port was &ldquo;approved&rdquo; (I found this out by calling the AT&amp;T port center @ 1-188-895-1097), it asked me to enter some information and finish it. Fantastic. I enter the information and it throws some error and drops me to a person. They can&rsquo;t find the number and after searching for a few seconds let me know that there is a &ldquo;due date&rdquo; of 3 days from now at 11pm. No problem, that is still not <em>that</em> long. I&rsquo;ll wait it out.</p>

<p>After a few more days of waiting and 2 more short calls to AT&amp;T (one when they were closed), the number is now ported in. The port was very easy once the approval process was done and the time had elapsed.<br />
I opted to forward my number to <a href="http://grandcentral.com/">GrandCentral</a> to start off with, they have more options as far as forwarding and screening calls so I figured I&rsquo;d try them first.<br />
I still have a feeling I may be getting the cell fusion phone system with the answering machine, but the band-aid has been ripped off at this point; the hard part is done.</p>

<p>Back out plans are in place, if the service is just awful I still have almost 3 weeks to back out, return the cell line and port my number back in, hopefully without a reconnect fee since we would be considered a &ldquo;win back&rdquo; customer.</p>

<p>Only time will tell. Let the testing begin.</p>

ion accounts listed in the book of Genesis are not only all correct, but are also in the correct chronological order? That the Bible doesn&rsquo;t say the Earth was formed in six 24-hour days but rather six long but finite periods of time? That the Bible makes 10 times more creation claims than all major &ldquo;holy&rdquo; books combined with no contradictions, while these other books have errors in them? The Bible stood alone by concurring with the big bang saying, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth&rdquo; (Genesis 1:1); and says our universe is expanding, thousands of years before scientists discovered these things. Watch a potential life-changing video on the front page of WWW.BIBLEFREEDOM.COM with Astronomer(PhD) Hugh Ross explaining all these facts based on published scientific data. He has authored many books, backed even by atheist scientists. Jesus fulfilled more than 300 Messianic prophecies concerning His birth place, details of His life, His mission, His nature, His death, and His resurrection. He came to pay a debt that we could not, to be our legal justifier to reconcile us back to a Holy God; only if we are willing to receive Him: &ldquo;For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord&rdquo; (Romans 6:23). God so loved the world that He gave us His only begotten son, so that whoever believes in Him, through faith, shall not perish, but have everlasting life. Jesus says if we wish to enter into life to keep the commands! The two greatest commands are to love God with all your heart, soul, strength, and mind; and your neighbor as yourself. All the law hang on these commands. We must be born of and lead by the Holy Spirit, to be called children of God, to inherit the kingdom. If we are willing to humble ourselves in prayer to Jesus, to confess and forsake our sins, He is willing to give the Holy Spirit to those who keep asking of Him; giving us a new heart, leading us into all truth! Jesus came to free us from the bondage of sin. The everlasting fire was prepared for the devil and his angels due to disobedience to God&rsquo;s law. If we do the same, what makes us any different than the devil? Jesus says unless we repent, we shall perish. We must walk in the Spirit, producing fruits of love and forgiveness, so we may not fulfill the lusts of the flesh being hatred, fornication, drunkenness and the like. Whoever practices such things will not inherit the kingdom (Galatians 5:16-26). If we sin, we may come before Jesus to ask for forgiveness (1 John 2:1-2). Evil thoughts are not sins, but rather temptations. It is not until these thoughts conceive and give birth by our hearts desire that they become sin (James 1:12-15). When we sin, we become in the likeness of the devil&rsquo;s image, for he who sins is of the devil (1 John 3:8); but if we obey Jesus, in the image of God. For without holiness, we shall not see the Lord (Hebrews 12:14). The oldest religion in the world is holiness (James 1:27). What religion did Adam and Eve follow before the fall? Jesus, Who became the last Adam, what religion does He follow? Is He not holy? He never told us to follow any religion or denomination but to deny ourselves, take up our cross daily, and follow Him (Luke 9:23). There are many false doctrines being taught leading people astray. This is why we need the Holy Spirit for discernment. Unlike religion, holiness cannot be created. It is given to us from above by the baptism of the Spirit. Jesus is more than a religion; He is about having a personal relationship with the Father. Start by reading the Gospel of Matthew, to hear the words of God, to know His character and commandments. Follow and obey Jesus, for He is the way, the truth, and the life!

<p>I intended to compose you this very small observation in order to thank you very much again regarding the incredible tactics you&rsquo;ve documented here. It&rsquo;s certainly remarkably open-handed of people like you to allow freely what exactly most people would have made available as an e book to end up making some money for themselves, most notably seeing that you could have tried it if you decided. Those solutions also worked to be the great way to realize that many people have the identical passion just like my own to grasp somewhat more when considering this problem. Certainly there are millions of more enjoyable times ahead for individuals who take a look at your website. <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/salaulatalaga/cellcosmet">https://hub.docker.com/r/salaulatalaga/cellcosmet</a> <a href="https://headwayapp.co/sahdepundit-changelog">https://headwayapp.co/sahdepundit-changelog</a>
