			<p>This was brought to my attention by <a href="http://www.jokerjitsu.com/">Mike Aref AKA JokerJitsu</a> and I HAD to post it. It is too good to <em>not</em> watch. I&rsquo;m a big <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000118/">John Carpenter</a> fan and having <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084787/">The Thing</a> remade using G.I. Joe characters, with the care that was used to do this deserves talking about.<br />
