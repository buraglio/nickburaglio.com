			<p>Man, watching the <a href="http://www.lakai.com/06/index.php">Lakai Fully Flared</a> video atmy friend Sean&rsquo;s suggeston makes me really miss skating every day. At 33 It&rsquo;s a little hard on my body after all the abuse but I did get the board out and do a few kickflips and curb tricks for the neighbor kids today. It was worth it but, unfortunately, it made my body really feel the years of abuse. I may kick around at the C-U park a little tomorrow&hellip;&hellip;<br />
Hopefully I&rsquo;ll still be able to walk afterwards&hellip;&hellip;..</p>

<p>I think Jeff Byrd owes me $5 for still skating after I hit 18 Years old.</p>

<p>Watch this and feel in awe&hellip;..</p>
