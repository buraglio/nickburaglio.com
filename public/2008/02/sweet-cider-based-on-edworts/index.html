			<p>Sweet Cider (based on edwort&rsquo;s apfelwein)</p>

<p>1/13/2008</p>

<p>3 gallon batch</p>

<p>Use 100% Apple juice, no preservatives.  (Indian Summer is a good brand, I believe I used the generic equivalent that was readily available)</p>

<p>Added <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> gallon of 100% juice to 6.5 gallon carboy</p>

<p>Added <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> # of corn sugar to remaining amount in bottle.</p>

<p>Mixed (shook) until dissolved.  </p>

<p>Added remainder to carboy</p>

<p>Repeat 1x</p>

<p>Pitched 1 packet Nottingham ale yeast right through funnel</p>

<p>Added final gallon to carboy to wash down remaining yeast. </p>

<p>I forgot to take a gravity reading at brew time =(</p>

<p>2/9/2008</p>

<p>Gravity is 1.001</p>

<p>Racked onto 32oz 100% raspberry juice into a 3 gallon carboy.</p>

<p>I had enough left over for 1 22oz bottle so I added ~1 oz of 100% apple juice (same brand) and bottled it.  </p>

<p>Initial impressions from tasking the reading sample:</p>

<p>It seems a little more cider-ish than Edwort&rsquo;s apfelwein but definitely sweeter.  Not overwhelmingly sweet, but like I expect a cider to be. </p>

<p>I plan to let it sit another week or 2 and then bottle condition / carb.</p>
