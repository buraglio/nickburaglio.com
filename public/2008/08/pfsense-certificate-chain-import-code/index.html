			<p>I updated some code to make importing certificate chains work under pfSense. It&rsquo;s been a long time coming and the code is probably messy since I&rsquo;m not a programmer but, for anyone that needs this, it should work.</p>

<p>There are 4 files that need touched:<br />
captiveportal.inc<br />
system.inc<br />
services_captiveportal.php<br />
system_advanced.php</p>

<p>All are contained in the tar file <a href="http://www.buraglio.com/nick/projects/scripts/php/pfsense-certchain-working.tgz">here</a>.</p>

<p>These were all written under 1.2, so using them on other versions may cause unforseen weirdness.</p>

<p><strong>BACK UP YOUR EXISTING FILES BEFORE USING MINE!</strong></p>

<p>Please, remember that these are currently unsupported by the pfsense team, feel free to email me and I&rsquo;ll do my best to help but I do have a day job and somewhat of a life, so I&rsquo;ll answer as I get time. Use at your own risk, I&rsquo;m not a developer so these may not be optimal code, insert other random disclaimer here.</p>
