			<p>As much as I respect DAvid Lynch, I have to disagree about watching movies on the iPhone (or laptop, or any mobile device). It&rsquo;s too darned convenient when traveling, even if it does change the experience.<br />
From Gizmodo: Always thought that watching movies on a tiny portable device is a crummy experience in pretty much every way possible. Crazy-ass director David Lynch (of Mulholland Dr., Lost Highway and Twin Peaks fame) thinks so too. Vehemently. And even if he is a little nuts, his faux iPhone ad both educates and entertains.</p>

<p>This is probably NSFW:</p>
