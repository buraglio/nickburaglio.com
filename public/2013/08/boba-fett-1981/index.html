A Star Wars action figure that I had thought was lost to the sands of time, used as a dog chew or generally played with and abused by a 6-7 year old in the early 1980&rsquo;s then tossed into the abyss of garage sale and second hand toys&hellip;..My original <a href="http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Boba_Fett">Boba Fett</a>. Boba Fett, before the prequels ruined the mystique, was the most intriguing, most widely loved minor character in the Star Wars universe. I remember very clearly as a child in 1983 , with my mother, watching <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi">ROTJ</a> in a theater in Decatur, IL, lamenting the fact that Boba Fett had been reduced to Sarlaac food with such minor fanfare&hellip;how could the movie go on? The draw of Boba Fett was that he was not really a villain, he was vilified, but he was really just morally ambiguous. Good?  Evil?  Boring.  Boba Fett was a working man.  He did the job and he did it well.  Damn the morals, rules and laws. He didn&rsquo;t need the force.  He didn&rsquo;t need a cause.  He got shit done regardless. I remember that this figure, along with IG-88, which I broke the right arm off of, were my two favorite and most prized action figures.  Ever. Period. Of all star wars characters, I always identified most closely with Boba Fett. I never really wanted to be a Jedi as a kid.  It was cool, but Boba Fett had style and power without the shackles of the labels of good or bad that the force imposes.  Not a Jedi but skilled in his own way, not to be trifled with.  Does what needs done.  Who <em><strong>wouldn&rsquo;t</strong></em> want that? Like Peter Griffin once said: No Matter How Sure I Am, I <strong>Never Risk The Fett Man</strong>..</p>

money was still currency. This Mark couldn&rsquo;t be spiritual because the word references two different physical locations. If it was spiritual it would just say in the forehead. RFID microchip implant technology will be the future of a one world cashless society containing digital currency. It will be implanted in the right-hand or the forehead, and we cannot buy or sell without it! We must grow strong in Jesus. AT ALL COSTS, DO NOT TAKE IT! &ldquo;Then a third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives his mark on his forehead or on his hand, he himself shall also drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out full strength into the cup of His indignation. He shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name” (Revelation 14:9-11). People have been saying the end is coming for many years, but we needed two key things. One, the Third Temple, and two, the technology for a cashless society to fulfill the prophecy of the Mark of the Beast. Visit WWW.BIBLEFREEDOM.COM to see proof for these things and much more! If you haven&rsquo;t already, it is time to seek God with all your heart. Jesus loves you more than you could imagine. He wants to have a relationship with you and redeem you from your sins. Turn to Him and repent while there is still hope! God bless!
