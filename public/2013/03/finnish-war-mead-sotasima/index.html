			<p>Based on some comments in the thread of my <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2010/01/03/making-mead-a-simple-process/" title="Making mead. A simple process.">how to make simple mead how-to video</a>, I threw together this 1 gallon batch of &ldquo;Sotasima&rdquo; or &ldquo;Finnish War mead&rdquo; based on <a href="http://matiaswilkman.blogspot.com/2011/04/home-brew-scene.html">this recipe</a>. I, of course, took out the refined sugar and substituted honey. Here is the result: I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d make it again, it&rsquo;s very tart regardless of the fact that it&rsquo;s been bulk aging for a year and that I used a sweet yeast. It was a fun project, though!</p>
