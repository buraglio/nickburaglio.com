      <description>This is an example page. It&amp;rsquo;s different from a blog post because it will stay in one place and will show up in your site navigation (in most themes). Most people start with an About page that introduces them to potential site visitors. It might say something like this:
 Hi there! I&amp;rsquo;m a bike messenger by day, aspiring actor by night, and this is my website. I live in Los Angeles, have a great dog named Jack, and I like piña coladas.</description>

What is your vision at now? What was your vision before you started? Nick Buraglio - Sep 1, 2015
I don&amp;rsquo;t have the 20&amp;frasl;20 scale for my old vision but my prescription was -3.75 in my right eye and -2.75 in my left. As of today I am still 20&amp;frasl;15 in both eyes.

      <description>The ramblings on this site never seem to have any consistency. Actually, that’s a bit of the point. And to that point, I am going to journal and present something that I have wanted to do for as long as it has been doable. LASIK. Laser eye correction, to be more specific. I’ve wanted to not wear glasses or contacts since the day I got them in the 9th grade.</description>

      <description>I am and always have been a huge Star Wars fan. I am old enough to remember ESB and lucky enough to have seen ROTJ in the theater. However, I, like many die hard fans, was completely turned off by EP 1, 2 and 3. So much so that I have erased them from my memory and consider them to never have existed. That is why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t terribly excited when I heard that there was a new one being released (and being directed by J.</description>

      <description>Perhaps I&amp;rsquo;ll be coming off as a &amp;ldquo;walked to school uphill both ways in 10 feet of snow&amp;rdquo; old guy, but when I was growing up in the late 70&amp;rsquo;s and early 80&amp;rsquo;s it seems like we fixed more &amp;ldquo;things&amp;rdquo;. If your refrigerator had a problem, you called a repair guy. If your TV went on the fritz, you called a repair guy. If your clothes dryer broke, you had someone come to fix it.</description>

An interesting discussion is worth comment. I think that you should write more on this topic, it might not be a taboo subject but generally people are not enough to speak on such topics. To the next. Cheers Zachariah Budzynski - Feb 6, 2019

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a bit of a coffee nut. I love good, high quality coffee. I&amp;rsquo;ve written about it many&amp;rdquo;), many, many, many times. In fact, I have a hard time getting going before coffee in the mornings, having been a coffee drinker since I was ~17 (I have no clue how my teeth aren&amp;rsquo;t stained; it baffles the dentist). I don&amp;rsquo;t drink soda, just coffee, water and beer. So, when a kickstarter for the Hey Joe brewing coffee mug was brought to my attention, I thought &amp;ldquo;wow, why has no one done this before?</description>

Thanks for revealing your ideas. I might also like to say that video games have been actually evolving. Today&amp;rsquo;s technology and enhancements have made it simpler to create authentic and fun games. These entertainment video games were not actually sensible when the concept was first of all being tried out. Just like other forms of electronics, video games also have had to progress as a result of many decades.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a sucker for my old toys. I never throw anything away and I still have a huge amount of my toys from the late 70&amp;rsquo;s through the 80&amp;rsquo;s. That is what makes this find so interesting. I had a few of these &amp;ldquo;Adventure People&amp;rdquo; manufactured by Fisher Price, and I played with them a lot, but I had all but forgotten about them until I pulled this one, the &amp;ldquo;opticon&amp;rdquo;, out of a box my oldest son and I were looking through.</description>

      <description>I recently had a weird problem with my plex media server in that it would crash upon trying to scan my library. After a great deal of debugging, I finally found what the problem was (a file that was named in such a way that it caused the scanner to crash). In order to debug this problem, though, I came across some great under-the-hood tools within plex (which is all python, very cool).</description>

Кто владеет информацией, тот владеет миром - эти слова выдающегося предпринимателя Натана Ротшильда как нельзя лучше характеризуют настоящую ситуацию с трудоустройством в России. Платить рабочему зарплату не будут только лишь на основе корочки из техникума. Зарабатывать действительно хорошие деньги может только тот человек, который владеет знаниями, умениями и практическими навыками по своей специальности. Если Вы - талантливый работник, но не можете устроиться на предприятие, потому что у Вас нет документа об образовании - обращайтесь в &amp;ldquo;Учебный центр&amp;rdquo;!</description>

      <description>Are you old enough to remember the amazing IBM model M keyboards? I am. And I loved mine. I had several of them as did my roommate from that time.
I remember in the mid 1990s working for a consulting firm in central IL, and during that employment one of the tasks put to us was to install a network with new PCs. Since this was a large company we were doing this for, they wanted to write off all of their items being replaced (or so I was told), so we threw the old stuff into a gigantic dumpster.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Plex, you should be. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the most flexible, well supported, useful pieces of entertainment software ever written. Oh, and it&amp;rsquo;s open source. That&amp;rsquo;s right, it&amp;rsquo;s free. And it&amp;rsquo;s cross platform. And it will run on just about any device. It&amp;rsquo;s quite amazing, actually. Plex also supports a myriad of plugins and features such as Channels, DLNA and cloud sync as well as the notion of clipping existing videos such as youtube content for display on your television or other devices.</description>

      <description>One of the gifts I received from my wife this year for the holidays was a Contigo Autoseal Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler, 16 Oz. she knows just how much coffee I consume and shares my love of good, artesian and small roaster coffees. I was excited when I popped this out of the stocking, but I honestly wasn&amp;rsquo;t prepared for just how awesome this mug really is. I generally don&amp;rsquo;t like to use plastic for travel mugs so I have an assortment of stainless steel and ceramic travel mugs.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written in the past about my love/hate relationship with messenger bags. Well, I decided to revisit….and I must say, I&amp;rsquo;ve changed my tune. I believe that the problem I had was the fact that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t getting the right messenger bags. I did a little reading and found that there are messenger bags and there are professional class courier bags. After reading and reading and reading and reading, I finally had it narrowed down to two bags.</description>

Hey, how&amp;rsquo;s it going? I want to pass along some very important news that everyone needs to hear! In December of 2017, Donald Trump made history by recognizing Jerusalem as the captial of Israel. Why is this big news? Because by this the Jewish people of Israel are now able to press forward in bringing about the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible. Jewish Rabbis have publicly announced that their Messiah will be revealed in the coming years who will be a leader and spiritual guide to all nations, gathering all religions under the worship of one God.</description>

      <description>Roughly a month ago I gave up Facebook. Let me clarify: I did not delete my account. I deactivated it. The difference is important to help understand my actions and for anyone that is considering taking a break from FB but may not want to delete the Facebook world entirely (or &amp;ldquo;commit facebook suicide&amp;rdquo; as others have called it). the difference is explained in decent detail here. Flash back to early 2005.</description>

      <description>While at my parents last weekend, my oldest son together with my youngest brother both pointed out that they&amp;rsquo;d found one of my most prized possessions, both as a 6 year old and even today at 38 years old. A Star Wars action figure that I had thought was lost to the sands of time, used as a dog chew or generally played with and abused by a 6-7 year old in the early 1980&amp;rsquo;s then tossed into the abyss of garage sale and second hand toys&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>I am a big fan of movies. I had an enormous VHS collection, then lasterdisks, now DVDs and Blu-Rays. I worked in a video store back in the early 1990s. I minored in film in college. For a period of time during college I saw literally every movie that was released in the theater, even if I had no desire to see it. I wanted to appreciate any artistic value it may have.</description>

I agree with you that while I look the look of messenger and similar bags (they do seem more professional looking, particularly when I&amp;rsquo;m wearing a suit and tie), but for general function it&amp;rsquo;s hard to beat a backpack. I had a Tom Bihn Empire Builder as my last bag and it didn&amp;rsquo;t quite work for me, though I loved the look (http://www.tombihn.com/laptop_bags/TB0730.html). Now I have a Everki Versa backpack and I love it, though it is compact.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve done a fair amount of traveling in my life, specifically in the last 11 or so years. During those years, I have been all over the world, both personally and professionally, and I learned that checking bags is inconvenient. I stopped doing it. I will never check a bag if I&amp;rsquo;m traveling for less than 7 days. I have always taken a backpack as my personal item / overflow bag.</description>

      <description>Yes, that is me in a ridiculous beret. No, I don&amp;rsquo;t actually walk around in a beret, it&amp;rsquo;s just for &amp;ldquo;artistic shock value&amp;rdquo;. But, just like most people, I have had a &amp;ldquo;social media &amp;ldquo; presence for a long time. However, unlike many, I have had an &amp;ldquo;online presence&amp;rdquo; that predates stereotypical social media by a very long period of time. I have a fine art background. I&amp;rsquo;ve always enjoyed creating things, drawing, photography, writing, video production, basically anything that lends itself to creativity.</description>

      <description>A constant figure in our lives for the last 15+ years, Chloe was our faithful companion. I recall taking her to work with me in my early days in the networking industry, going in on Saturdays to study and lab stuff up as far back as 1998. I would often drive an hour from Bloomington to Champaign to let her out and walk her while Rebecca was studying during her time in veterinary school.</description>

what ratio did you use to replace the refined sugar with honey? Also, did you just replace the white sugar with honey or did you also replace the brown sugar as well? buraglio - Aug 6, 2013
I have never used refined sugar so I have no real ratio, I generally use a gallon of honey for ~4 gallons of water and adjust accordingly based on how much I want to produce.</description>

      <description>Based on some comments in the thread of my how to make simple mead how-to video, I threw together this 1 gallon batch of &amp;ldquo;Sotasima&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Finnish War mead&amp;rdquo; based on this recipe. I, of course, took out the refined sugar and substituted honey. Here is the result: I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d make it again, it&amp;rsquo;s very tart regardless of the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s been bulk aging for a year and that I used a sweet yeast.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of post-apocalyptic movies. In fact, next to humorous horror / gore movies (that&amp;rsquo;ll be my next list), I think they&amp;rsquo;re my favorite. This is a subject that my longtime friend and fellow movie enthusiast (as well as ex-video store co-worker) Sean Holland and I have discussed at length. In fact, this is eventually to the be subject of our first podcast. So as not to spoil the content of said podcast, I&amp;rsquo;m just going to give a list with minimal detail as opposed to a complex description of my reasoning.</description>

I have realized that over the course of making a relationship with real estate proprietors, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to get them to understand that, in every real estate transaction, a commission amount is paid. Finally, FSBO sellers tend not to &amp;ldquo;save&amp;rdquo; the commission rate. Rather, they fight to win the commission through doing an agent&amp;rsquo;s task. In this, they expend their money and time to complete, as best they will, the tasks of an adviser.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a pretty active person for a long as I can remember. I try to stay physically fit and have done a lot of competing in my life. Triathlons, 5k, 10k, century bike rides, submission grappling tournaments, boxing…..lets just say I like to get out and push myself. I&amp;rsquo;ve trained with several guys that fought in the UFC….granted, they kicked my rear….but that doesn&amp;rsquo;t change the ffeact that I worked with them over the course of the last 10 years of my training.</description>

      <description>--I feel that this post is worthy of a cross post from coldlocals.com since it is a very important topic for me.
This time of year always reminds me of a time in my life that was a pivotal, life changing period for me. In 1988, I was transitioning out of BMX and BMX Freestyle and was looking for something individual, something I could do that didn&amp;rsquo;t require a team or a group but was something I could do myself, as an individual.</description>

      <description>The other night the boys and I were out and about in Urbana, IL. While we were roving around, we stopped by the Art Coop. I like to get my art supplies from a local source if possible. While we were there, I happened upon a shelf of very odd &amp;ldquo;action figures&amp;rdquo;. I wanted to buy them all but settled for pictures of the most strange.
I really enjoyed the &amp;ldquo;Lunch Lady&amp;rdquo; one for some reason.</description>

      <description>He was on;y supposed to live a year. 13 years later, we lost him and discovered how strong of a presence he actually was. The only cat to steal a cheese stick right from my hand and eat it. You will be missed, good sir. Very much.</description>

      <description>We didn&amp;rsquo;t get to go last year due to my son Zach being born&amp;hellip;.this year we were determined to makeit up for the staghorn cask tapping. Well, we were successful. It seemed a bit more low key this year, but the food was amazing and the beers were&amp;hellip;..better than can be described. The staghorn cask was wow-factor good.
Here is a little video of the cask tapping I stitched together.</description>

I spied this Subaru (woohoo!) Impreza driving down Neil St. here in Champaign the other day on the way home from work. Google street view making it to the corn field!
The tech on the inside looked pretty neat. Had they been parked I would have requested a look at it from the seemingly teenage driver (he looked to be about 18 or 19 and appeared to be extremely bored).</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s no secret that I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of photography. I&amp;rsquo;ve been into it since I was young, doing skateboard photography and eventually ending up with an undergraduate degree in fine art photography. I was a film hold-out and didn&amp;rsquo;t move to a digital format (at least for anything other than point and shoot) until 2006.
I am also a pretty serious mac user. I can work on about any platform, but everything I own, save for a linux server in my basement and a D-Link NAS, is apple.</description>

      <description>One of the things about the internet is that it is a good place to put things that you never want to forget. Stories, pictures, music, video, anything. Once it&amp;rsquo;s on the &amp;lsquo;net, it&amp;rsquo;s likely there for good as there is no way to know if it can ever be completely deleted. As I thought about that, and as I near my 37th birthday, I relaized that there are a lot of things that are word-of-mouth stories about &amp;ldquo;adventures&amp;rdquo; that myself and my friends had as youngsters growing up a bit different in a rural Central Illinois town.</description>

      <description>I had very high hopes for iMessage. With the release of iOS 5, one of the big new features was iMessage, the ability to do Blackberry messenger style messaging on an iOS device. I had really hoped that this would be something like wifisms or the DeskSMS app for Android. At the very least I was hoping for iChat integration with iMessage.
This didn&amp;rsquo;t happen.
Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, iMessage is still really cool.</description>

      <description>I spent some time up in Alaska recently (Fairbanks, to be exact) and I have to say, it was pretty intersting. I taught the ipv6 workshop and participated in a few other talks at Joint Techs, Summer 2011. I didn&amp;rsquo;t have a ton of time to spend all around the last frontier, but I did get to do a bit of light hiking and exploring on my last day there (before Delta Airlines botched my return flights).</description>

This van is amazing. I always wanted a &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; van, like an A-Team or Scooby Doo van, but was never really able to make it happen. As of last week, though, we&amp;rsquo;re the owners of a 2011 Toyota Sienna. This 2011 Toyota Sienna is just downright amazing. It drives like a car but has the volume of a full sized van.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a great device, even though I was underwhelmed when it forst came out. After using it a bit I realized that it&amp;rsquo;s like a hybrid between my iPhone and my MacBook. A more convenient device for quick but more detailed work or entertainment.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m extremely irritated by the one last blog that I host on wordpress that I just can&amp;rsquo;t seem to get converted to any other format.
Wordpress, while a very nice publishing platform, isn&amp;rsquo;t quite compliant with the XML standard in the way that they format their export files. So, what that means for anyone that has a decent sized blog that they want to move to anything other than wordpress, is that they may be out of luck.</description>

      <description>I saw this over at my brother&amp;rsquo;s blog, and it looks pretty amazing. I&amp;rsquo;m a really big fan of zombie and post-apocalyptic stuff and this appears to have high potential. I&amp;rsquo;ve not read the graphic novels (although I will be obtaining it and reading it before the premiere), but if Mike says it&amp;rsquo;s good, it probably is.
AMC has been pumping out some really good stuff, lets hope this lives up to the trailer.</description>

      <description>That is the million dollar question on many phone geeks minds.
The iPhone is really a love it or hate it kind of device, much like Apple stuff in general. Android, on the other hand, is still new enough that some folks are still ignoring it. Well, I wanted to know which worked better for me, and so I set out to test them both.
For the purposes of this test, I&amp;rsquo;m used an HTC Nexus One running both Stock and CyanogenMod firmware (Android 2.</description>

It was fun wasn&amp;rsquo;t it! I have a bunch of photos from the weekend on my website www.suepics.com in the Oktoberfest Gallery. Nick Buraglio - Oct 5, 2010
Those are some great images. I saw a few people doing some photography at Oktoberfest and I was lamenting the fact that I didn&amp;rsquo;t bring any of my camera gear. ArlieBig - Mar 6, 2019

      <description>We went up to New Glarus, WI this past weekend to celebrate Oktoberfest. It was a fun filled weekend with a lot of good beer and good friends. A bit more low key than I expected, which was all the more appealing to me. Below is some bad cell phone footage of Dan Carey (brewmaster of NewGlarus Brewing Company) tapping the wooden staghorn keg (cask?) that I shot with my phone after several mugs of Staghorn.</description>

      <description>Only 2.5 years after the original &amp;ldquo;Beer making 101&amp;rdquo; video was posted to Google Video was posted, I finally got some time to edit together a &amp;ldquo;Beer making 101, Bottling&amp;rdquo; segment. It was a bit thrown together, so the quality isn&amp;rsquo;t that great, and I had to edit out some stuff due to youtube&amp;rsquo;s 15 minute duration restriction, but you&amp;rsquo;ll get the basics.</description>

      <description>The video of The Wormhole Coffee Shop was sent to my by my younger brother today. This place looks to be so full of awesome; I had to watch this video twice. It&amp;rsquo;s like my childhood and my adulthood had a baby and that baby was an amazingly cool coffee shop! What is not to like about Doc Brown&amp;rsquo;s DeLorean Time Machine!?!
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been there, but as soon as I get back up the Chicago area, I&amp;rsquo;ll be making a special trip to get some coffee at this place.</description>

So, how did I usher in the new pair?</description>

      <description>I had been wanting to see the film &amp;ldquo;Beautiful Losers&amp;rdquo; since I&amp;rsquo;d heard of it, and I finally had the opportunity to sit down and really enjoy it. This is certainly a movie worth your time if you are interested in real artists, living and working like real artists in todays world.
I originally wanted to see this because of the heavy influence from the skateboarding world (a world I spent a very good deal of my youth in) but also because I had always aspired to be an artist (and even went and got a degree in arts and technology).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve more or less realized that as I get older, my memory retention is getting worse. I have always had a pretty good memory, but it&amp;rsquo;s oddball things that I remember, like quotes from Ghostbusters or my friends phone numbers from grade school.
I&amp;rsquo;ve never been great at taking notes and so, to that end, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to work on doing just that.
I have taken one of the many oddball domain names that I own, in this case coprophage.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a huge fan of movies and film. I have a minor in film studies from Illinois State University and did (sometimes still do) a bit of video art. I&amp;rsquo;ve embraced the technology at this point and use Netflix quite a bit and watch movies as I get time.
I have a fairly extensive DVD (and now Blue Ray) collection as well.
Here you can find the top few movies off of my Netflix queue.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m liking the move back to blogger so far. I do miss some of the flexibility that wordpress gave me, but overall I&amp;rsquo;m willing to trade that for not running a database server anymore. Blogger is available over IPv6 using the google over any v6 resolvers, which is very cool, and the VPS I moved to at ARP networks to host DNS and basic HTTP is also fully v6 native.</description>

      <description>Outside of networking (and even within networking to a certain extent), the buzzword of the day is &amp;ldquo;The cloud&amp;rdquo;. All of your data will be in &amp;ldquo;the cloud&amp;rdquo;. Think Skynet. Cloud computing is how much of our data is handled today.
What is that, you ask? &amp;ldquo;Cloud computing is Internet-based computing, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to computersand other devices on demand, like the electricity grid.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash;According to wikipedia.</description>

      <description>My Blogging has come full circle. I had originally investigated CMS/WYSIWYG type blogging years ago using blogger. After about a year I moved it to my own self hosted service using newsbruiser, then to movable type, and finally to a self hosted wordpress instance.
Well, I&amp;rsquo;m moving all of my web hosting away from my colocated server and to other locations. For my own stuff, I&amp;rsquo;ve move all of it back to blogger using a custom domain.</description>

Aside from this it&amp;rsquo;s likewise significant or a writer to possess the particular understanding about the subject of the essay so that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to manage any trouble later on when writing the essay. Before composing very good post, you need to clearly understand what kind of essay he or she&amp;rsquo;s meant to write whether it&amp;rsquo;s a journalism article, professional article, review article or article for a website because every one of such articles have their personal specified writing styles.</description>

      <description>Last weekend my son put my wife&amp;rsquo;s iPhone in the dog water. Needless to say, it didn&amp;rsquo;t survive. Since I had an old Blackberry 8100 I decided to give my iPhone to her and take the Blackberry until we could either replace or repair her damaged phone. This was a much harder transition that I had anticipated. I used the 8100 &amp;ldquo;Pearl&amp;rdquo; for about 6 months before upgrading to the original iPhone back in 2007 and had no issues with it.</description>

 Wifes iPhone in the dog water, check. Garage fridge compressor not working, check. Today is going to be expensive. #
 My blackberry pearl from 2007 is *awful* compared to my not-even-recent iPhone 3g that the wife now has.</description>

Since writing a summary may occasionally be tedious job since this is the location where you truly begin contemplating your essay seriously. Feelings that will keep you from writing your book. Essay writing normally comes as a challenge for people that aren&amp;rsquo;t utilised to writing essays and it&amp;rsquo;s a very enormous job typically for the pupils who don&amp;rsquo;t have any type of experience in writing essays.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been making mead as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been making beer, and frankly, mead is much easier. I&amp;rsquo;m not a big wine drinker or really even a fan of wine, but mead is so easy to make and it turns out well with minimal work so I make it a few times a year. Here is a quick and dirty howto on making simple, traditional mead that I threw together a few nights ago: Mead is a good choice for those wanting to start with zymology, as it takes few ingredients and can be done on a budget.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;ve had one since the beginning, but I am feeling a bit of device envy for some of those &amp;ldquo;other&amp;rdquo; phones out there. I really like that I am basically carrying a unix box around in my pocket, and that I can install apps and sync calendars and contacts and send and receive email&amp;hellip;..and that it all works seamlessly from my mac.
Many of those things are actually pretty straightforward and widely available&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>This week I received a Purple belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu under Jack McVicker. Having trained in bjj since about 2002 under Jack, it was a very great honor to receive this promotion. Training with the high level guys that I work with several times a week certainly helps progression of skill and technique, of course having great instruction doesn&amp;rsquo;t hurt either.

      <description>When I was 18, much to my parents dismay, I purchased a motorcycle. My first bike, a 1974 Yamaha RD 350 , was a two stroke street bike. I did not know how to ride a motorcycle, had no helmet, no license, no insurance and no license plates. I bought it for $250 and had to learn to ride it to get it to it&amp;rsquo;s new home. I liked this bike and rode it all summer (with no license, insurance or plates) back and forth to my girlfriends house in the country.</description>

The features include:

      <description>Several people have mentioned triathlons to me in the last 2 weeks, which has me thinking&amp;hellip;..could my injury riddled body, damaged from years of skateboarding, distance running, boxing and submission wrestling handle another triathlon?
I have not participated in one since 2006, and really not trained properly for one since 2005&amp;hellip;..I have also not run any event runs or races since 2007 (or run at all since 2007 due to my very beat-to-hell back).</description>

Nice research Rob. The math bears out your conclusion that LEDs are less costly of the life of the bulbs compared to the alternatives. I wonder whether 20+ years is what one can realistically expect from an LED bulb’s lifespan. I remember expecting 10 years or so from CFLs but never saw that ever. When I would put in a new CFL, I would write the installation date on the bulb’s socket for reference.</description>

      <description>While rooting through a box in my basement, I came across something that I had no idea I still had. It was my very first watch, a cat-in-the-hat winder. I remember receiving this little treasure as a gift for xmas, probably around 1980. I was really young so memories are a little hazy, but I do remember wearing it proudly to grade school on it&amp;rsquo;s black leather band (now lost). I pulled this thing out of that box and it was like a blast from the past.</description>

      <description>Lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been going through old boxes of stuff, organizing and cleaning up. I never really packed well, or unpacked some of the stuff from when before I was married, with many things just thrown in boxes with reckless abandon. In rifling through the ill-packaged containers of my junk, I&amp;rsquo;ve happened across some treasures. Here are some examples:

I&amp;rsquo;ve also found things like the glass and keychain from my senior prom as well as the dried corsage.</description>

      <description>My wife is super cool. Not only is she a great mom to our son, she&amp;rsquo;s smart, hot and actually listens to me when I talk about stuff I know she&amp;rsquo;s not interested in. Case in point, my birthday. I&amp;rsquo;ve always been a fan of watches and timepieces, and shes bought me several watches for my collection over the years.
This year we are a little busy and I actually forgot about my own birthday until she reminded me.</description>

      <description>There was once a day not so long ago when I had a wealth of knowledge about photography, photo equipment, color photo processors, digital image retouching and the hardware and software that it entailed. &amp;hellip;..well, 11 years later and a lot of that has changed. When I was doing it, digital cameras were terrible. They didn&amp;rsquo;t even compare to a good SLR or medium format camera. So, I stuck with what I knew, emulsion based photography, and got passed up.</description>

      <description>Anyone that knows me knows that I love T-Shirts. They&amp;rsquo;ve been pretty much the only thing I have worn for the bulk of my life, much to my mother and wife&amp;rsquo;s dismay. That said, there are a lot of shirt ideas that I&amp;rsquo;ve had in the past but I&amp;rsquo;ve never had any mechanism for making them. Often it&amp;rsquo;s not economical for local print shops to make just 1 or 2 shirts from a design, so a consumer needs to order them in bulk, making it not economical for the consumer.</description>

      <description>Image manipulation via either Photoshop, Gimp, or whatever is a wonderful tool and can provide hours of entertainment. In keeping with the skateboarding theme of the last few days, I decided to mess a little with some of the images and came up with this:

So retro! So old school! Wow, it&amp;rsquo;s a xeroxed image!
Reminiscent of the old do-it-yourself style that was so common in early skateboarding, I just had to have this image from the archives on a some sort of apparel.</description>

      <description>Many know that I was, and still am, a huge fan of skateboarding. I started around age 12 (1987), while in Jr. High and continued through college up through probably 4-5 years ago.
Being from a smaller Midwestern town there is not a lot to do, and not a terribly large amount of outside culture. Magazines are something that we&amp;rsquo;d read to get updated on the newest tricks, what was new, who rode for what team, etc.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a widely known fact that I love good coffee. There is something about waking up to the great smell of coffee brewing and then getting a drink of the first cup of the day that is invigorating.
I like to cook, and I really like to make interesting things and I really, really like to make stuff that tastes good (who doesn&amp;rsquo;t?), so when I make coffee I try to make the best tasting coffee that I can.</description>

Both Luke and his strong, resilient mother are doing exceptionally well. There have been a lot of friends and family swinging by to visit, with more to come.

      <description>I have a few cron jobs that run on my home mac machines and I like to get the notifications generated from the MAILTO parameter. Well, a while ago (I believe after the comcast acquisition of insightbb), this stopped working. I did a little debugging and it is my belief that port 25 is being blocked outbound from the comcast network. Many people speculatethis, and as a network engineer I think it is actually a good idea.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been revisiting IPv6 a lot again lately, and one thing I wanted to do was to get my home network back running IPv6 again after having it off for a while. IPv6 isn&amp;rsquo;t that hard to understand, configure, route or use, it&amp;rsquo;s just different and I need to know it well for my job so this is a good excuse to play around and re-read some of the books I bought years ago on the subject.</description>

Well, I found a trailer. the quality isn&amp;rsquo;t the greatest but at least it gets the point across that the movie looks pretty darned awesome.</description>

      <description>A lot of folks have asked me about the Blackberry Storm. Well, it looks like an impressive device, and if I still had Verizon Wireless and didn&amp;rsquo;t already have an iphone 3g, I&amp;rsquo;d very likely have one of these.
Rumors were flying about initial firmware issues, sluggish behavior and general buggyness, but it appears that they&amp;rsquo;ve been working on the problems and have fixes either on the way or already here.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not really sure how I missed this, probably because it&amp;rsquo;s some students doing the work, but nevertheless, it&amp;rsquo;s very exciting.
This is something that has been unavailable for the most part under *BSD, but available for quite some time under Linux. I personally don&amp;rsquo;t like iptables and find it much less elegant than pf, both in implementation and practice so seeing this work is very encouraging and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to test it out.</description>

      <description>As many know, I love T-Shirts, and the only thing better than a great T-Shirt, is a great shirt from a classic 80&amp;rsquo;s movie of my childhood.
Thank goodness there is Found Item Clothing. These guys recreate so many of the shirts from classic pop culture and just all around great movies (they also have a pretty good movie/dvd review section).
Anyway, in keeping with their awesome tradition, they&amp;rsquo;ve released even more new shirts.</description>

I was able to enjoy this the other night thanks to my brother-in-law Rob. I would highly recommend this big brew to anyone that has $ to drop in one big, dark, powerful beer.</description>

      <description>That iPhone Dev team has decided to port the linux kernel and BusyBoxto the iPhone and write a completely new boot loader to support dual booting.
iPhone Linux Demonstration Video from planetbeing on Vimeo.
I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that it really means anything for everyday users of the iPhone at this point, but it&amp;rsquo;s certainly interesting for geeks, hobbyists, code hackers and possibly developers.
If I had a spare iPhone I might give it a whirl just to see it work, but since I don&amp;rsquo;t I&amp;rsquo;ll just be satisfied with the announcement.</description>

Anyone that has to deal with these protocols will likely find this a decent reference, and since they&amp;rsquo;re all things that network engineers use all the time, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have them all in one place.</description>

      <description>buraglio - Nov 4, 2008
A quick follow up on day #2 of &amp;ldquo;the phone experiment&amp;rdquo;. So far Grand Central is working very well. I am, however, having a fairly major problem with the Cell Fusion. It won&amp;rsquo;t seem to stay paired with my Nokia 6085. The Bluetooth pairing connects and disconnects about every 30 seconds, making it nearly useless as far as using the DECT handsets. It could be the Nokia, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to dome some quick experiments.</description>

      <description>** Check comments section for follow up details.
Where to actually start on this&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;.
Since the availability of LNP (Local Number Portability) I&amp;rsquo;ve contemplated moving our landline number that has been in place for about 10 years to a family share type of line on our cell plan.
Why, you may ask, would one even bother to keep a land line in this day and age other than e911 service or a DSL or other data service line that requires it?</description>

      <description>I am a fan of audio books since I rarely have time to read any fiction (or even nonfiction) anymore the iPod (and now iPhone) have been a great help in making my time more versatile and allowing me to enjoy some books that I would otherwise not have time to enjoy.
The biggest limitation that I have run into is that iTunes (and by nature the iPod/iPhone) doesn&amp;rsquo;t play as nicely as I think it should with mp3 files as it does with it&amp;rsquo;s m4b, the format it uses for audio books, and many of the free audio books come as mp3 format.</description>

      <description>My old office building located on Neil street in Champaign burned down this morning! It was an old building, built in 1870 I believe, and had a significant amount of issues being that old. It had been undergoing a major renovation since floors two and three had not been used since around 1970 and 1940 or 1950 respectively.
The employer that I worked for, Sol Tec, INC. purchased the building around mid-to-late 2001 and sold it a few years later.</description>

I, for one, would love to test one (especially if it meant I could finally have 3g).

      <description>I happen to love It&amp;rsquo;s always sunny in Philadelphia.
I find it&amp;rsquo;s lack of tact and willingness to push the envelope of good taste refreshing. In fact, one of their recent episodes (who pooped the bed) has a striking similarity to a funny story from my college days when we told everyone that Carl pooped the bed (which he really didn&amp;rsquo;t, but damn was it funny).
The strange pop culture references like mac wanting to be a cooler (like from Roadhouse) is downright genius and the physical humor is pretty darned good too.</description>

      <description>As I have done every year (save one) since its inception, I headed over to the annual Urbana Beer and Chili cook off in Downtown Urbana. My expectations are never really high because of the usual things that go along with running such an event in a college town. It is promoted by Jay Goldberg Events, the owners of the canopy club if I understand correctly. It is more or less worked by volunteers who know little to nothing about the beverages they are serving, but there is a decent selection (I believe all coming from Premium Brands distributor).</description>

      <title>Buraglio&#39;s Pale Ale</title>

      <guid>https://nickburaglio.com/2008/09/buraglios-pale-ale/</guid>
      <description>I decided it was finally time to brew one of my favorite styles for myself. I jumped in with both feet on this one, what I hope to be a VERY hoppy Pale Ale, which I&amp;rsquo;ve so creatively titled &amp;ldquo;Buraglio&amp;rsquo;s Pale Ale&amp;rdquo;.
The recipe can be found on Google Documents here.
Here is an image of it fermenting after 2 days. This was my first batch ever that actually needed a blow off tube rather than a simple airlock.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve long been a fan of Found Item Clothing, they have some really obscure shirts that aren&amp;rsquo;t found elsewhere and are pretty diligent about reproducing them as closely to the original as possible. I have several of their shirts and have always been very happy with both the quality and the service.
In keeping with their tradition of finding cool ideas from (often underrated) 80&amp;rsquo;s movies, they&amp;rsquo;ve introduced the &amp;ldquo;Death Before Disco&amp;rdquo; sweatshirt from Stripes.</description>

      <description>I always enjoyed watching Evan Tanner fight and really liked his aggressive style. He had a great ground-and-pound game but was a much more well rounded fighter as well as an interesting person than what most MMA fans saw. Anyone that read his personal blog on any regular basis saw that he was both a charismatic and gifted person and troubled individual. I never had a chance to meet him in person but the game and the world will surely miss such a unique individual.</description>

      <description>I got my keg order in and it looks like I can fit 2 kegs plus a co2 dispenser in the beer fridge. The local homebrew club got such a great deal on the kegs that I decided to put off switching to all grain and spend the money on a kegging system. I was able to get five used 5 gallon kegs plus new seals for $80 through our local club (we did a huge order).</description>

      <description>In the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been in what can only be described as a mission to taste as much good beer as I can. On the short list, all of the stuff at the the Morgan St. Brewery in STL(the dark wheat was excellent, as was the altbier).
I&amp;rsquo;ve also been on a Belgian Ale kick, having just bottled mine a few days ago. The Hoppin&amp;rsquo; Frog Belgian Strong ale is a favorite of mine.</description>

      <description>This Movie / Documentary looks very cool. IT should be playing at Boardman&amp;rsquo;s soon. This guy is crazy, but it kinda makes sense.
It&amp;rsquo;s getting great reviews:
&amp;ldquo;I am afraid of heights. Now you know. That is one reason I was helplessly engrossed in &amp;ldquo;Man on Wire,&amp;rdquo; the story of how Philippe Petit crossed eight times on a tight-wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center on Aug. 7, 1974.</description>

      <description>I updated some code to make importing certificate chains work under pfSense. It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time coming and the code is probably messy since I&amp;rsquo;m not a programmer but, for anyone that needs this, it should work.
There are 4 files that need touched:
captiveportal.inc
system.inc
services_captiveportal.php
system_advanced.php
All are contained in the tar file here.
These were all written under 1.2, so using them on other versions may cause unforseen weirdness.</description>

Hey, how&amp;rsquo;s it going? I want to pass along some very important news that everyone needs to hear! In December of 2017, Donald Trump made history by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Why is this big news? Because by this the Jewish people of Israel are now able to press forward in bringing about the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible. Jewish Rabbis have publicly announced that their Messiah will be revealed in the coming years who will be a leader and spiritual guide to all nations, gathering all religions under the worship of one God.</description>

      <description>Since many folks have asked for this recipe, I decided that I should actually go and copy it from my notes to my Google Docs archhive of recipes.
This beer was a bit of a surprise, I made it with some pretty old ingredients a little last minute and didn&amp;rsquo;t expect much from it. I pitched it onto an existing yeast cake from my vanilla porter and just let it go.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a little frustrated with the Wordpress conversion, overall I think it&amp;rsquo;s probably better than movable type, but the primary driver for making the changeover was so that I could use the mobile support that came out for the iPhone. Well, I seem to be running into a fairly common bug in it, in that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be able to read my configuration or write to my pages.</description>

Well, after about an hour and a half of editing and a realization that my camera work for this one really kinda stunk, I was done and had a 30 minute &amp;ldquo;documentary&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So I watched a few skate videos last night and I HAD to get my board out. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty awful anymore but I did manage to get some bad video of me doing a few simple tricks.
I think I could pick up some of my old tricks, I may try some curb work at some point and see how well that goes&amp;hellip;.</description>

At 33 It&amp;rsquo;s a little hard on my body after all the abuse but I did get the board out and do a few kickflips and curb tricks for the neighbor kids today. It was worth it but, unfortunately, it made my body really feel the years of abuse. I may kick around at the C-U park a little tomorrow&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;</description>

Great wordpress blog here.. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to find quality writing like yours these days. I really appreciate people like you! take care [Almeta Pitchford]( &amp;ldquo;Hurrle@gmail.com&amp;rdquo;) - Sep 0, 2019
I wanted to send you that very little remark to thank you very much once again just for the pleasing ideas you&amp;rsquo;ve shown in this article. It&amp;rsquo;s simply surprisingly open-handed with people like you to supply extensively just what a lot of people could have offered for an e book to make some cash for themselves, primarily considering the fact that you might well have tried it in case you wanted.</description>

      <description>Look up your favorite soft drink and see how it compares to others. This is not usual data on the back of the label. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting that the diet drinks have some of the highest levels.

      <description>No one really has enough time (or money) to see every movie released every year, but shamefully too many great films are left in the dust. Sure, maybe you&amp;rsquo;ll see a couple of those indies that are making the rounds on the year-end top ten lists, but even those critics missed a few good ones. Watch all of these.

      <description>As much as I respect DAvid Lynch, I have to disagree about watching movies on the iPhone (or laptop, or any mobile device). It&amp;rsquo;s too darned convenient when traveling, even if it does change the experience.
From Gizmodo: Always thought that watching movies on a tiny portable device is a crummy experience in pretty much every way possible. Crazy-ass director David Lynch (of Mulholland Dr., Lost Highway and Twin Peaks fame) thinks so too.</description>

This time Darpa-funded scientists have found a drug that eliminates sleepiness with a nasal spray of a key brain hormone, with no apparent side-effects.

While this would be difficult to do with current MacBooks, it fits perfectly with the idea of the ultra-light, ultra-slim MacBook that allegedly will be presented at MacWorld.&amp;rdquo; The images and description looks quite cool.

      <description>With the impending release of the iPhone firmware 1.1.3 there are a lot of additions, most important to me being the inclusion of multi recipient SMS messages (something that should have been there from day one). cre.ations.net has a video of one of the other cool features, movable icons (something available with a jailbroken iPhone for a long time). Anyway, it&amp;rsquo;s nice to see apple actually including it. I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting to see the *actual* release date, it&amp;rsquo;ll probably be around Macworld, but who knows.</description>

      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;ve aggravated a (likely very old) back injury once again and can&amp;rsquo;t train or work out nearly as much as I used to until it&amp;rsquo;s healed, I have decided to try my hand at making beer&amp;hellip;.and wine (or is it cider?)&amp;hellip;.and mead&amp;hellip;.
I&amp;rsquo;ve gone a little overboard.
I&amp;rsquo;ve bottled my first batch, an English Brown ale, and after bottle conditioning for about 2 weeks it&amp;rsquo;s actually pretty darned good. Nice and clear, not cloudy like I would have expected.</description>

      <description>The Contents of the /var/root/Library/Keyboard file on an iPhone contains all non-default dictionary words. Not likely a problem, but it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to know if personal or private information is being stored on a mobile device.

It does all the old stuff on both old and new iPhone versions. I have a feeling that there will be a firmware upgrade coming pretty close to the Leopard release this week, which will likely break all of this again&amp;hellip;.. Let the madness begin (again).

      <description>Over at Google Code, the iphone-elite team has released their revirginizing tool, which is designed to rebuild your iPhone&amp;rsquo;s seczone lock table. After using this tool, the team suggests, your 1.0.2 unlocked iPhone will return to its pre-unlocked state and be safe to upgrade to 1.1.1. I&amp;rsquo;m sure that this is a VERY welcome release for those that unlocked their delicious little iPhones with an early release of iUnock or anySIM, which basically prevented an upgrade (or bricked an unlocked phone) to Firmware 1.</description>

      <description>eBay is great and all, but the days are getting fewer and further between that you can actually find a good deal on there. I found this little article that has 13 other places to look. That said, eBay is still a pretty good place to find obscure stuff, even if you do have to pay a little more.

      <description>Well, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I think I&amp;rsquo;m going to wait and not get an iPhone. As much of an Apple zealot as I am, this may seem like a strange choice. Well, with a lot of the details surfacing with it&amp;rsquo;s impending release, I think it&amp;rsquo;s just too early. While I believe Apple is a very good company and makes quality hardware and software, I think that this is far too new of a market for them.</description>

      <description>I am not a programmer, but the idea of creating useful software intrigues me. I&amp;rsquo;ve taught myself enough Python to do simple things and I can usually modify and understand most Perl scripting as well as do some stuff in PHP.
Ruby is something that I always heard was really nice (much like Python), so I decided I was going to try and learn some of it. There are some really useful tools for doing things on your OS X mac with ruby (and Python), things like RB-Appscript, an apple event bridge for Ruby.</description>

      <description>Some stuff as leaked about the pricing of the iPhone from apple to be launched by Cingular/AT&amp;amp;T in the next few months. Surprisingly (to me at least) the prices were $200 lower than was expected. I&amp;rsquo;m still ion the fence about switching to Cingular and gettin an iPhone. I like the idea of Rollover, and I love the idea of having a SIM in my phone. On the other hand, I have been relatively happy with Verizon for a few years and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I can give up the calendar or functions my Treo offers.</description>

Hey, how&amp;rsquo;s it going? I want to pass along some very important news that everyone needs to hear! In December of 2017, Donald Trump made history by recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Why is this big news? Because by this the Jewish people of Israel are now able to press forward in bringing about the Third Temple prophesied in the Bible. Jewish Rabbis have publicly announced that their Messiah will be revealed in the coming years who will be a leader and spiritual guide to all nations, gathering all religions under the worship of one God.</description>

      <description>In the airport in Minneapolis, MN there were at LEAST 2 vending machines (in the American Airlines terminal) for iPods. I literally did a double take, then wished I would have come up with the idea. Put your credit card in and get any model of ipod, from shuffle to 80gig video. They also had accessories, chargers, and prepaid cingular mobile phones. Put in your credit card and get an ipod, it was actually pretty slick.</description>

Kudos to the author, it&amp;rsquo;s very useful. There are also shutterfly exports, picasaweb export plugins, the list goes on and on. I guess I&amp;rsquo;m just spoiled by the fact that I never have to use a windows box.</description>

      <description>Check out how slick this road is! Crazy. It looks like a game of bumper cars and seems to go on forever:
Speaking of crummy weather, my less-than-a-year-old subaru had a branch fall on it this weekend and literally shatter out the hatchback window due to high winds. Very uncool, very inconvenient. It had to be a freak thing, the place it hit was right above the body, which basically took out the entire back window.</description>

      <description>December 11, 2006 was quite possibly the worst day I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had. Not only did we lose a best friend to an unnecessary, insidious form of cancer, but he was taken from us after less than 7 years. Although no amount of time would ever have been enough, 6 and a half years was far, far too short.
Lenny became a quick part of our family because of his sweet disposition and laid back attitude.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a widely accepted opinion that Fox news seems to be a little biased. I really don&amp;rsquo;t watch the news so I had only others speculation to draw upon. Then I saw this. It certainly gives a compelling argument in favor of that opinion. Thankfully, I get most of my news from the net.

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a lot of Doctor Who lately. I always enjoyed it as a kid (the Tom Baker Doctor). I think it was my grandpa and his love of british humor that introduced me to &amp;ldquo;The Doctor&amp;rdquo;.
&amp;hellip;So, on a whim, I went out and got the new (9th and 10th Doctor) Doctor Who seasons (2005-2006) and watched them. WOW. The storied were always great, funny and interesting, yet serious and entertaining at the same time.</description>

      <description>Stripes is a great movie. I bought the extended edition a while ago. While I believe Stripes is a &amp;ldquo;must own movie&amp;rdquo;, I was sorely dissapointed in the deleted scenes. For some reason I was thinking about Sgt. Hulka today, one quote in particular:
Soldier, I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed you&amp;rsquo;re always last&amp;rdquo; Winger replies with &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m pacing myself Sargeant&amp;rdquo;. Genius.</description>

I was/am a huge futurama fan, so news of the dvd movies and possible return with 13 new episodes was very nice. This nice little clip for the movie &amp;ldquo;An Inconvenient Truth&amp;rdquo; was also good (since I happen to subscribe to a great deal of what the movie says).</description>

      <description>I happen to love t-shirts. I&amp;rsquo;d be so bold as to say that I collect them, especially shirts that remind me of growing up. A group of us were talking about Total Recall, Kuato specifically, and I thought it would be cool to have a Kuato Lives shirt. Low and behold, someone else has already done it! [](http://www.cafepress.com/cp/prod.aspx?p=filmfanshirts3.71607441)[![Kuato1](http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/Kuato1.jpg)](http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2006/08/Kuato1.jpg) You can get the shirt from Cafe Press. I think I may order one.</description>

      <description>A few friends and I did the CU Across the prairie ride yesterday. The weather pretty much sucked, raining on us the majority of the ride. Sice the weather was so bad we opted to do the 47 mile route as opposed to the Metric century like last year. I must say, this year the ride was much less of a &amp;ldquo;Scenic&amp;rdquo; route than last year, and I, overall, was a little disapointed.</description>

      <description>Rebecca and I spent the weekend in downtown chicago to &amp;ldquo;get away&amp;rdquo; for a bit. It really was quite relaxing, even with my aggrivated back. We got the hookup and got into the Shed Aquarium for free, and circumvented the hour-long line. Quite cool. We enjoyed Shark Week, something I&amp;rsquo;ve done for a long time and were looking forward to seeing the sharks there. We certainly weren&amp;rsquo;t disapointed. I forgot the camera but managed to snap some crappy pics with my treo.</description>

      <description>I went to a SCinet meeting last week in Reno, NV to which I&amp;rsquo;d never been. I&amp;rsquo;ve also never been to Las Vegas, but Rebecca told me basically waht it was like, something that isn&amp;rsquo;t really my style. I don&amp;rsquo;t smoke and I don&amp;rsquo;t gamble, both of which are abundant in Reno. The hotel/casino we stayed in and had our meetings in reminded me of the movie Casino, everyone looking out of style and place.</description>

      <description>I did the &amp;ldquo;24th annual&amp;rdquo; Champaign Park District mini-triathlon again this year. It&amp;rsquo;s a very short sprint triathlon that the Champaign Park District puts on every year, it&amp;rsquo;s usually pretty fun, being very short and very close to my house. I had originally planned on training for this at least a little, but alas, I didn&amp;rsquo;t. Overall I did ok, placing 83rd overall out of 350 with a final time of 48 minutes and 01 seconds.</description>

      <description>Well, I am officially a &amp;ldquo;nerd&amp;rdquo; according to most of my friends. I set a goal for myself to get my HAM radio license, for a few reasons. The first being that I am goinf to be in Tampa, FL at the tail end of hurricane season adn want a way to contact people not via net or phone if need be. The second being that I have a severe lack of electronics knowledge and thought this would be a good way to get introduced.</description>

Madison is a great city, I&amp;rsquo;d never been there and Rebecca had been saying it was really funa nd beautiful. She was right. Pics from the event can be found here. They were all taken with my treo so they&amp;rsquo;re not the greatest.</description>

      <description>One of the greatesst shows of all times is coming to the bug screen! I&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for this for a LONG time. Strangers with Candy, one of the least PC and smartest shows to come out of Comedy Central is coming to theaters this month. I have a feeling that I&amp;rsquo;ll have to wait for it to make it to Champaign, IL but hopefully it&amp;rsquo;ll be worth it. I absolutely loved this show, as did many of my friends, but alas, many did not (or don&amp;rsquo;t) appreciate it&amp;rsquo;s humor much like many of the shows I enjoy[ed].</description>

      <description>I just read on a message board that I sometimes look at about a movie coming out based on the 2001 book American Hardcore by Steven Blush. It looks pretty good as far as documentaries go, although there was talk of how the book was somewhat incorrect. Of course, it is based on one guy&amp;rsquo;s experience as far as I know. I ordered the book today so I&amp;rsquo;ll hopefully get that read before the film is out, if not I&amp;rsquo;ll probably have to wait to see it.</description>

It came within a few feet of our house and the house across the street. It was kinda surreal to watch so I recorded it and took several pics with my Treo. Video can be found here and here.</description>

      <description>Some of Team Remarkable:
Well, the MS150 is done. Day 2 started pretty crummy. Rain, cold and general lack of enthusiasm on the general rider population was obvious. I was trying to be pretty upbeat, but it&amp;rsquo;s my belief that many riders (with the exception of team remarkable) just didn&amp;rsquo;t go out. We started a little late, around 0730 or so, about 15 minutes in the rain cleared and it dried up, but it stayed overcast mahing for a really nice ride.</description>

      <description>the first day was beautiful. Weatherwas great, no wind and low humidity. All of the volunteers did a bang up job. One can really teL how much they care about supporting those raising money to help cure MS. Rebecca had a tire blow out in the first 3 miles but got it fixed and finished the 35 with no problem. I did the 75 as did Jeff, Scott, Vic and Jeff&amp;rsquo;s friend.</description>

My back is still a little stiff and crooked from the muscle I pulled like 2 weeks ago, but I did a few 35 mile training rides and everything seems to be ok.</description>

      <description>Sweet! I love beer. I also love coffee. Hopefully it&amp;rsquo;s true! This article claims
&amp;ldquo;Coffee may counteract alcohol’s poisonous effects on the liver and help prevent cirrhosis, researchers say.&amp;rdquo;
The article also claims:
&amp;ldquo;The same study found coffee drinkers had healthier results on blood tests used to measure liver function, whether or not they were heavy alcohol users. Coffee’s effect on reducing liver enzymes in the blood was more apparent among the heavy drinkers in the study.</description>

      <description>A very tasty english black ale, the Moorehouse Black Cat is a dark malty ale. Full flavored with a little hoppy after taste. It is surprisingly refreshing, not overly filling, not overly hoppy. I don&amp;rsquo;t know the alcohol content, it&amp;rsquo;s not terribly strong, i&amp;rsquo;d estimate mayby a 6 or 7%. I picked this up at the local friar tuck for $3.99. I&amp;rsquo;d recommend this for anyone that likes dark brews.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m doing the MS150 bike ride again this year. It&amp;rsquo;s creeping up and I have not done any training other than short rides since my triathlon in Sullivan on May 6th. Weather has been crummy, and my new steed has been sitting in the garage begging to go for a decent ride.
But thats really not what the MS150 is about.
Along with Team Remarkable we hope to raise some good money for MS research.</description>

      <description>Well, as you can see if you actually read this thing, I got the entire blog imported from blogger. It really was a pretty easy task. There is a lot of documentation on doing it.
I started with this but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t as helpful as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped. I then googled for this and found pretty much everything I could have imagined regarding the process. Anyone looking to do the same should check out this article.</description>

      <description>I decided to move to a content management system that I have a little more control over. As of tonight, I have migrated to a Movable Type setup. All the previous articles have been archived at http://buraglio.com/archive/
I hope to get them imported into MT but have yet to be successful in doing so. Hopefully this will make for more frequent updates since I can update it more easily from my Treo 650.</description>

      <description>Even thought I just bought a new one, I really like the idea of not using a car, but instead being able to do day-to-day stuff on a bicycle. There are several reasons I feel this way, the first being that I strongly dislike being in a car. It&amp;rsquo;s not that comfortable (yes, I&amp;rsquo;m even talking about luxury cars), they&amp;rsquo;re expensive, gas prices are out-freakin-rageous, and the excercise you get on a bike is good for you.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s my opinion that a home foreclosure can have a major effect on the client&amp;rsquo;s life. Property foreclosures can have a Six to ten years negative influence on a applicant&amp;rsquo;s credit report. A borrower having applied for a home loan or any loans for that matter, knows that a worse credit rating will be, the more tough it is for any decent personal loan. In addition, it might affect a borrower&amp;rsquo;s chance to find a decent place to lease or rent, if that gets the alternative real estate solution.</description>

      <description>Well, I finally got the new road bike that I had been selling all my stuff off to get. It was a long process, dealing with Bianchi sending the wrong bike, Bikeworks getting enough time to assemble it, getting it home, getting clipless shoes (expensive!!) etc, etc. But it&amp;rsquo;s finally here and I must say, it&amp;rsquo;s FAST. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, I love my Trek 7300FX, I ride it to work whenever weather and work permits, but this is a road bike, and it&amp;rsquo;s quite a different experience.</description>

      <description>I did the Sullivan, IL Triathlon this sunday (4/30/06). It was REALLY windy with gusts of up to 37mph, which really sucked for the bike ride. I was hoping to ride my new Bianchi but it wasn&amp;rsquo;t done yet. I did ok, my knees were burning up so I didn&amp;rsquo;t time as well as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped but still finished with a respectable time (especially for someone who barely trained). Detals can be found here.</description>

Thanks a lot for the helpful write-up. It is also my belief that mesothelioma cancer has an extremely long latency time, which means that the signs of the disease may not emerge till 30 to 50 years after the primary exposure to asbestos.</description>

      <description>Well, I sold and shipped the last of my neo-classic star wars toys today. I&amp;rsquo;m a little sad about it but at 31 years old I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ll be playing with them. With the money I bought a new 2005 Bianchi Velochi from bikeworks in Urbana, IL. I got a sweet deal on it and it is one hell of a bike. He&amp;rsquo;s building it right now and I should have it this week.</description>

      <description>Well, Triathlon season is starting up so I won&amp;rsquo;t be doing a lot of drinking. I may make a post here and there but I don&amp;rsquo;t expect to be doing any kind of regular review till early September when all the races and training start to die down. On a lighter note, I came across 2 cases of Smithicks! Sadly, most of it is going ot have to wait a while before it gets to be enjoyed (unless my wife drinks it all!</description>

      <description>Well, I listed the bulk of my Neo-Classic (1990-2000) Star Wars collection on ebay. It&amp;rsquo;s kinda sad really, I wanted to collect these so bad to I guess try and recapture some of my early childhood. I had actually almost forgotten I had all of thisewhen my parents asked me to take some tubs of stuff out of their basement. I&amp;rsquo;d been wanting to get a new road bike but didn&amp;rsquo;t want to part with the money so I decided to sell this stuff to cover (I hope) most of a new Bianchi Eros or Veloce.</description>

      <description>So I&amp;rsquo;ve had basically the same palmos environment for about 4 years now. From my Sony Clie to my Treo600 to my Treo650 I&amp;rsquo;ve just done a sync when I got me new device and been done with it. I know, being a technical person I should know better, and I did, but I&amp;rsquo;m sometimes lazy when I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. It was the 2gig SD card that I got for $80 at Circuit City that made me do it.</description>

      <description>Treo a conversation piece? This week I went to our office in Arlington, VA to help test some fiber for 10g deployment and noticed something interesting. As I sit in the airport waiting for my flight back a guy sitting next to me asked about my treo. Now, this wouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be that interesting except for the fact that since I landed here just over 24 hours ago he is the 3rd person to strike up a conversation with me based on my treo 650.</description>

      <description>Dark and smokey (hence the name) and more hoppy than I expected. This is a good beer, sharp and not sweet like I expected. Brewed by otter creek brewing company and good with food. I enjoyed mine with dinner and the dinner I had really complimented the robust flavor. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure of the alcohol content but I picked mine up at the local piccadilly as a 6 pack and was buzzed after 2.</description>

It&amp;rsquo;s a well known fact that I love 80&amp;rsquo;s movies. Although Fast Times was a little before my time I did grow up watching a lot of movies in the genre on HBO or Beta and even more at the beloved Clintonia Theater.</description>

      <description>A few years ago I got into brazilian jiu jitsu and submission wrestling. It&amp;rsquo;s been somewhat of an obsession since then, taking any free time I can find to train or cross-train for it. As I&amp;rsquo;m getting a little older and 15 years of hard skateboarding have taken it&amp;rsquo;s toll on my poor knees and back, I try to train as hard as I can now for fear that I won&amp;rsquo;t be able to later.</description>

      <description>A dark, hoppy, dry ale. I picked this up at the local Corkscrew in Urbana, IL for $1.89. It is pretty hoppy which is accented well by the slight rye flavor. The rye seems pretty apparent in the aftertaste, which is strong but not as long lasting as eating a piece of rye bread. Strong in taste but not in potency. Worth a try, Brewed by Founders Brewery</description>

With all the talk of the CTA machines being vulnerable and other MTA machines crashing or being problematic I got to thinking about how many mission critical or sensitive systems are vulnerable, rooted, 0wn3d or whatever. Most Cash machines used to be OS/2 but that&amp;rsquo;s been changing lately and I know for sure some are moving to windows. Lets just hope all these systems are well maintained or more secured than they probably are&amp;hellip;.</description>

A decent punch but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure of the alc. content in this $2.99 pint bottle. I&amp;rsquo;d not had any food when I enjoyed it and was left with a little buzz. A dark carmel color with very little head, it was a good drink.</description>

      <description>Today, 02/09/2006, marks the end of an era. My pet Cockatiel Maxi (aka &amp;ldquo;Birdhead&amp;rdquo;) passed away last night sometime between 10pm and 8am. She was fairly old and had lived what I consider to be a good life. She was originally a breeding bird for an unknown number of years before relocating to the University of Illinois Veterinary school front desk area. There, for several years, she lived with a few other birds, many of which picked on her and pulled out her feathers.</description>

      <description>Aldaris Porteris Brewed by the Alderis Brewery in Riga, Latvia, this 6.8 percent alc. porter was not too heavy and not too sweet. A quick, carmel aftertast, it was a pleasant surprise of a porter for $2.49 at friar tuck. I love a good porter, it&amp;rsquo;s a fact. Dark and sweet ( but not too sweet ) I would recommend this delicious drink for any porter lover. A little heavy but VERY good.</description>

Thanks for the a new challenge you have revealed in your text. One thing I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to discuss is that FSBO connections are built with time. By bringing out yourself to owners the first saturday and sunday their FSBO is announced, prior to masses start calling on Monday, you generate a good relationship. By sending them equipment, educational components, free accounts, and forms, you become a great ally.</description>

      <description>One of the things that is somewhat lame about the employer paid verizon plan I have is the lack of the ability to dial #MIN (#646) to get an estimate of the minutes you&amp;rsquo;ve used. For some reason that feature is purposely disabled on the account. I found a nice free little app that works really well for this. It&amp;rsquo;s very configurable and once the tweaking has been completed (at least on my phone) it&amp;rsquo;s pretty accurate.</description>

      <description>Sierra Nevada Porter I saw this and couldn&amp;rsquo;t resist trying it. I must admit that I didn&amp;rsquo;t know that the Sierra Nevada Brewery made a porter. I was skeptical but went ahead and paid the $7.99 for a six pack. 5.6 percent alc. per 12oz bottle, it had a thin, light head when first poured. A much more bitter porter than I anticipated, I was a little disapointed to be truthful.</description>

      <description>Okocim porter &amp;ldquo;Traditional polish taste&amp;rdquo; it says on the bottle. A dark, thicker, quickly sweet porter. Malty and strong, sharp and quicker flavor than many porters I&amp;rsquo;ve had. 8.3 percent alc. in this one pint bottle that I picked up at Friar Tuck for $2.99. This was a little different in a way I really couldn&amp;rsquo;t put my finger on. I&amp;rsquo;d probably buy this again, but I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t drink more than one.</description>

      <description>I discovered a nice little app called CallFilter by Velocity Software recently. A lot of folks were raving about it on message boards and blogs so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d try it out and give a quick review of what I thought of it after using the (limited) demo they make available. Let me preface this by saying that I&amp;rsquo;m a big fan of screening calls and being able to know who is calling and from where.</description>

      <description>I am rough on stuff. I needed a good case for my Treo 650. I had many a choice in this area but was patricularly interested in the rubber &amp;ldquo;skin&amp;rdquo; type cases. I have wanted one of these for my ipod but never got around to getting one. I did a little readong and decided on the Spec Products Skintight case. I liked the fact that it had a sscreen cover that I could remomve if needed and came with a holster for when I was feeling particularly geeky and wanted to wear it on my pocket (which is rare).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve never been an early riser. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve been more of a night owl than anything else. I like to stay up late and sleep in. Well, some of the activities and lifestyle changes I&amp;rsquo;ve made just don&amp;rsquo;t allow for that anymore. Training for Triathlons, bike races and other physically demanding activities necessitate a &amp;ldquo;cleaner&amp;rdquo;, more organized lifestyle. Organized is something I am certainly _not_. In an effort to change this, I got a Treo 600.</description>

So when I had a problem with my 20gig ipod I figured if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t hardware I could fix it. Well, it was hardware. My wife got it for me in Feb. of 2004 for my birthday. She got it at best buy, and knowing how I am rough on stuff, she bought the extended warranty from them, giving it coverage till 2&amp;frasl;2008.</description>

      <description>After my last post regarding my treo I started looking into why certain apps were failing or whatever, specifically rmrdiet. Others were using this app on a treo 650 and it claims support. I reinstalled it to RAM (as opposed to my memory card) and it&amp;rsquo;s working very well now. This really is a powerful app for $20 (although I have still not paid). It seems to just give the nag screen and not a requirement for registration.</description>

      <description>In my apparently never ending quest to use my Treo 650 to it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely fullest capacity, I have found some helpful links that I thought others may find useful (I certainly did):
More up to date &amp;ldquo;Must have Software&amp;rdquo; list from Howard forums
A nice thread on keeping your Treo 650 up and running with minimal crashes.
I&amp;rsquo;ve found that my treo 650 is pretty stable but not quite as rock solid as my 600 was, which had less than 1 crash a month.</description>

      <description>Wow. The 650 is much different than the 600. I opted to get a 650 as opposed to waiting for the 700w (Palms first PocketPC based device), I generally never get something I need to rely heavily on that is a first release, or the 700p (palm based, supposedly exclusive to SprintPCS for 6 months after release).
I have had to re-learn a lot of the subtleties of the treo platform.</description>

      <description>Wow, the treo 650 is a huge step up from the Treo 600. Better Screen, better camera, MUCH better QWERTY keyboard, etc, etc. I&amp;rsquo;ve had mine about 24 hours now and damn, I like it a LOT. I am still waiting on my accessories, Plantronics BT headset and cool rubberized case but even w/o them this thing is very nice. A few things to note if upgrading from the 600:</description>

      <description>I added a seperate sub category (that I hope to recruit some people to work on with me); beer reviews. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to do beer write-ups but have never really been a &amp;ldquo;beer expert&amp;rdquo; or a &amp;ldquo;beer snob&amp;rdquo; so I thought that I probably shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do it. Then I got to thinking, maybe thats why I *should* do it. I always hated reading pretentious beer drinkers account of some beer they had after playing a polo match or before getting into their limo to be whisked away to their private jet and flown to switzerland to count their money.</description>

      <description>I made my request for a Verizon Treo 650 this week to replace my beat up Treo 600. After much researach and reading I came to the following accessories:
Plantronics Voyager 510 headset: $52.24
Spare Battery TRE650BAT $29.99
Car Charger TRE650VPC $22.49
Spec Skintight Holster $34.95
Screen protectors $15.95
These were heavily influenced by stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve seen other people with as well as reviews on Treonauts
I find this device, while a little large for my tastes, to be invaluable.</description>

I have always wanted to start a T-Shirt company, not for profit so much as for fun. This may become a reality, but thats a story for another time.</description>

I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a &amp;ldquo;Beer Snob&amp;rdquo; as I&amp;rsquo;ve been known to drink anything from PBR, Natural Lite and Stag to a $12 imported porter. I&amp;rsquo;m not normally a big fan of the lighter stuff but I came across this ale, Smithwick&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

Can I simply say what a reduction to seek out somebody who really knows what theyre speaking about on the internet. You definitely know how you can deliver a difficulty to light and make it important. More folks have to learn this and understand this facet of the story.

      <description>training again So I started training again after a month and a half of on-again off-again training and boy does it go quickly as you get older. The submission wrestling and cycling cardio are quick to slip away. Having been wrestling now for about 2 weeks (at 2 times a week, I&amp;rsquo;m not yet up to 4 again) I thought the cardio was a little better, but alas, as I hit the cycle at the gym this morning I was rudely awakened by tired legs and sucking wind.</description>

      <description>The breakup of the blog really didn&amp;rsquo;t work. I have been so busy with work that I didn&amp;rsquo;t post at all. I had been traveling a lot lately, Seattle, Mexico, back to Seattle. All in all I was gone about a month. Seattle is probably the coolest US city I&amp;rsquo;ve been to, not as rain-soaked as many say. Both times I was there (a 4 day trip and an 11 day trip) for work it drizzled a bit but for the most part it was pretty nice.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m such a spaz. My interests are all over the place. I don&amp;rsquo;t think that just one blog is enough so therefore I&amp;rsquo;m playing with the idea of breaking it up into 3 categories. One of my friends, Mike Aref, has just put his training journal online and it has given me inspiration to do the same. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be breaking up my blog into 3 blog-like sections, training, technical/geeky, and hobbies (like beer, film, games, travel, etc)&amp;hellip;.</description>

      <description>Ahhh, many things have happened since my last post. I went to seattle to help with Scinet, Rebecca and I went to Mexico (cabo san lucas) for vacation, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been preparing for my return trip to Seattle for Supercomputing &amp;lsquo;05. The one thing I hate about travel is that it interrupts my training schedule. I especially miss the submission wrestling and jiu jitsu, I even miss the conditioning. I had to miss 2 submission tournaments and have to miss one more.</description>

      <description>I started trying to make some packages for the pfsense platform. I&amp;rsquo;mnot really a developer and don&amp;rsquo;t know xml or php so I&amp;rsquo;m using this as an excuse to learn. My first attempt is with pftabled, a very useful c program for free and openbsd for manipulating pf tables remotely. First pass is available here</description>

      <description>I came across this deal at slickdeals.net. Yahoo has domain purchases for $1.99 per year. Normally I use godaddy but this was too good of a deal to pass up. I picked up nickburaglio.com again (I had let it lapse back in like 2000) for a couple of years for under $4.00 and moved the blog over to it. Not too bad of a deal for a self indulgent domain such as this.</description>

      <description>I did the CU across the prairie metric century ride this weekend. We started at about 0845 and got finished around 1330, not a bad time for someone as inexperienced as myself I think. We did stop at 2 rest stops along the way for water. It was pretty fun, I never realized that Monticello, IL had so many nice houses out in the country around there. The head winds sucked toward the end and we had gotten started a little late, so heat was a small factor too.</description>

      <description>The other day I came across pfsense while looking for stuff I could use on my openbsd based version of basically the same thing. I was intrigued by this because it was using altq as well as pf, which was the main reason that I was working on a similar product under openbsd. Upon actually installing it on a Soekris I was even more impressed. I installed it on a NET4801 with a wireless and crypto card and have been using it as my internet gateway for a few days.</description>

      <description>I did a little mini-triathlon on the 6th. It was actually really fun, except for the part where I rode an extra 1.17 miles on the cycling part. I got confused as to where to stop and was in such a zone that I passed it right up. In retrospect I think I should have practiced swimming, which I didn&amp;rsquo;t do much at all. I was sucking wind after about 100meters due to the fact that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t breathing in a consistent manner.</description>

      <description>My back is feeling better and I&amp;rsquo;ve resumes training for my sprint triathlon. I have not yet really started back at boxing, jiu jitsu or wrestling but hopefully this thursday I&amp;rsquo;ll be rolling with some friends from home. Speaking of home, the Clinton Daily Journal ran a story on us doing the ms150 bike tour. It didn&amp;rsquo;t have the whole story online so I made a quick scan (above).</description>

      <description>Well, too many years of skateboarding have taken their toll on my 30 year old body. An old injury from ~10 years ago has once again reared it&amp;rsquo;s ugly head. After doing my normal Saturday morning workout and doing one 5 minute round my back started to tighten up. By the time I had gotten home I could barely get out of the car. So much for training hard for the mini triathlon that I&amp;rsquo;m (hopefully still) doing.</description>

      <description>I finished the ms150, although not the way I had originally intended. The first day was 75 miles. Not too bad. We set off at about 6am, it was relatively pleasant outside. There was a rest stop for water, energy bars, fruit and bathrooms about every 8-13 miles (basically in every small town we went though). These were amazing. Some even had cooked food like egg sandwiches, etc I stocked up at pretty much every one, got water and a snack.</description>

      <description>I signed up for a mini triathalon. It&amp;rsquo;s not too harsh, actually, it looks like it&amp;rsquo;s a perfect one to start with. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly a mini, including a 400meter swim, a 2 mile run and a 6 mile bike ride. Details can be fouind here. I figure it&amp;rsquo;ll be a good way to maybe stay in shape for any jiu jitsu or submission tournaments I may do later in the year.</description>

      <description>MacOS Tiger had/has some issues with the Cisco VPN client. It was a widely public fact. I experienced it first hand. But, being that I have admin access on our VPN concentrator I was able to get the newest clients to *kinda* work. There were still a lot of issues with the &amp;ldquo;compatible client&amp;rdquo;. Now that Cisco has released the client version 4.6.04 (0061) it&amp;rsquo;s much better, but sleeping and waking the machine with the client connected yields funkyness, yeah, I know you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t do that anyway, but some do.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty well known fact that I like Apple computers and most people have seen a lot of the spam and ads referring to getting a free mac mini or a free ipod. I always thought they were BS. A scam attempt to harvest email addresses or another version of something nasty.
Well, interestingly enough, I actually know someone who really DID get the free Mac Mini, I saw it.</description>
