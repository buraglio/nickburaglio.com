			<p>A major TV network hit me with a nastygram telling me that my T-Shirt that I had made, and never sold or even bought for myself, was infringing on their copyright and trademark of a certain high school character played by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-Paul_Gosselaar">Mark-Paul Gosselaar</a> that carried a giant phone. I dare not even mutter the name, which was in the title of the shirt, for fear that the media giant come and take away my will to live.</p>

<p>OK, I was probably naive in using the name. I profusely apologized and left the unsold product off the market.</p>

<p>The kicker, however, was that they claimed that the image, that was a picture of me (who looks NOTHING like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-Paul_Gosselaar">Mark-Paul Gosselaar</a>), was &ldquo;evocative&rdquo; of their copyright and trademark.</p>

<p>Wow, that is a stretch. A big stretch. Here is the text that I received:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;We own the rights to the character &ldquo;[name I dare not mention out loud]&rdquo; and the design is still nonetheless evocative of our copyright and trademark. You have been put on notice. Thank you for your prompt compliance.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>For reference, here is the image, wholy created and owned by me (and also a picture OF me).</p>
