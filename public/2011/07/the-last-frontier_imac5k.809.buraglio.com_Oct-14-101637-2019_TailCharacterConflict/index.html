			<p>I spent some time up in Alaska recently (Fairbanks, to be exact) and I have to say, it was pretty intersting. I taught the ipv6 workshop and participated in a few other talks at <a href="http://events.internet2.edu/2011/jt-uaf/">Joint Techs, Summer 2011</a>. I didn&rsquo;t have a ton of time to spend all around the last frontier, but I did get to do a bit of light hiking and exploring on my last day there (before Delta Airlines botched my return flights).<br />
I think other than the conference (which was really good), the highlights were certainly the food. I had an Elk burger at <a href="http://www.pumphouse.com/">The Pump House</a>, ate myself stupid at the <a href="http://www.akvisit.com/salmon.html">Alaska Salmon Bake</a>, had a few really good brews and a delicious bison burger at <a href="http://www.silvergulch.com/">Silver Gulch Brewery</a>, and hung out until the sun went down (wait, it never sets in Fairbanks in July) at <a href="http://www.myspace.com/marlinfairbanks">The Marlin</a>. (<a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/the-marlin-fairbanks">Yelp</a>). All were totally worth while. While Fairbanks was a little smaller of a college town, it&rsquo;s a big city in Alaska. If I ever make it back there I&rsquo;d really like to hit up the <a href="http://www.chenahotsprings.com/">Chena hot springs</a>. If I had it to do over again, I would have taken my nice DSLR camera and made another trip to Silver Gulch (the northernmost brewery in the United States). Oh, I also saw the northernmost Denny&rsquo;s, which was proudly displayed on a sign.</p>

<p>I grabbed a few pictures with my iPhone and my point and shoot available <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio/sets/72157627095838577/">here</a> or in this slide show.</p>
