			<p>I got a 64Gig Ipad for xmas. I love it. I use it all of the time for work, at the gym (for watching video on the bike) at home and on the road.<br />
It&rsquo;s a great device, even though I was underwhelmed when it forst came out. After using it a bit I realized that it&rsquo;s like a hybrid between my iPhone and my MacBook. A more convenient device for quick but more detailed work or entertainment.</p>

<p>Now, merely 2 months after I got mine, there is a new one. I knew that would happen, thats the way tech stuff always works, especially apple. Do I want the new one, of course. I&rsquo;m like a kid when it comes to gadgets. Will I get the one one? Not likely. I&rsquo;s more likely that I&rsquo;ll wait until iPad 3.</p>

<p>I found <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/03/04/conan-obrien-produces-a-more-honest-ipad-2-promotional-video/">this Conan O&rsquo;Brien skit</a> pretty entertaining given my &ldquo;iPad circumstance&rdquo;</p>
