			<p>I&rsquo;m extremely irritated by the one last blog that I host on wordpress that I just can&rsquo;t seem to get converted to any other format.<br />
Wordpress, while a very nice publishing platform, isn&rsquo;t quite compliant with the XML standard in the way that they format their export files. So, what that means for anyone that has a decent sized blog that they want to move to anything other than wordpress, is that they may be out of luck. Google has a pretty robust set of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-blog-converters-appengine/">blog conversion tools</a>, which worked for me for all of my sites, personal and business&hellip;&hellip;except for one. As stated <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-blog-converters-appengine/issues/detail?id=45">here</a>, wordpress2blogger gives me &ldquo;not valid XML&rdquo; error when trying to convert. I&rsquo;ve cleaned this file as best I can by hand, but it&rsquo;s enormous and I&rsquo;m still missing pieces. It&rsquo;s irritating and at this point I&rsquo;m almost ready to keep this one as a one-off and install mysql, wordpress, etc., etc., etc&hellip;&hellip;.</p>

<p>Thanks wordpress.</p>
