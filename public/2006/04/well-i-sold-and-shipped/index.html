			<p>Well, I sold and shipped the last of my neo-classic star wars toys today. I&rsquo;m a little sad about it but at 31 years old I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll be playing with them. With the money I bought a new 2005 <a href="http://bianchiusa.com/05_veloce.html">Bianchi Velochi</a> from bikeworks in Urbana, IL. I got a sweet deal on it and it is one hell of a bike. He&rsquo;s building it right now and I should have it this week. I rode a few other bikes, a Trek and a Lemond (AL frame bikes) but none were as smooth as the Bianchi&rsquo;s I rode. The creamy shifting and light, quick but smooth ride was something I couldn&rsquo;t stop thinking about as I rode the others. It&rsquo;d not a daily rider, mind you. That seat is reserved for my Trek 7300FX, but it&rsquo;ll be a sweet training and race bike!</p>
