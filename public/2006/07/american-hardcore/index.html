			<p>I just read on a message board that I sometimes look at about a movie coming out based on the 2001 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0922915717/sr=8-1/qid=1152885461/ref=pd_bbs_1/103-7856446-4511028?ie=UTF8">American Hardcore</a> by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/index=books&amp;field-author-exact=Steven%20Blush&amp;rank=-relevance%2C%2Bavailability%2C-daterank/103-7856446-4511028">Steven Blush</a>. It looks pretty good as far as documentaries go, although there was talk of how the book was somewhat incorrect. Of course, it is based on one guy&rsquo;s experience as far as I know. I ordered the book today so I&rsquo;ll hopefully get that read before the film is out, if not I&rsquo;ll probably have to wait to see it. These are probably some of my favorite bands and types of music, although I came in after most of it was over in the late 80&rsquo;s, partially due to the fact that I was born in 1975 and partially because I lived in a small midwestern town of about 7000 people with no real ties to anywhere that anything groundbreaking was happening.
