			<p>Well, I am officially a &ldquo;nerd&rdquo; according to most of my friends. I set a goal for myself to get my HAM radio license, for a few reasons. The first being that I am goinf to be in Tampa, FL at the tail end of hurricane season adn want a way to contact people not via net or phone if need be. The second being that I have a severe lack of electronics knowledge and thought this would be a good way to get introduced. I sat for the Tech ticket last Sunday and passed it and was issued <a href="http://www.qrz.com/detail/KC9JVU">KC9JVU</a> as my callsign as of yesterday. I applied for a vanity callsign today so we&rsquo;ll see how long that takes. I have been playing with <a href="http://www.dogparksoftware.com/EchoMac.html">echomac</a> and the <a href="http://www.irlp.net/">IRLP</a> stuff, it&rsquo;s pretty slick; right up my alley with the VoIP stuff. Now I can legally have a scanner in my car, too. Now to re-learn morse code&hellip;&hellip;</p>
