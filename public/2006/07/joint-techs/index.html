			<p>I went to <a href="http://jointtechs.es.net/">Joint Techs</a> in Madison, Wi this week. Overall it was pretty good, I learned a lot of stuff and experienced a lot of the dynamics of some major networking initiatives. Madison is a great city, I&rsquo;d never been there and Rebecca had been saying it was really funa nd beautiful. She was right. Pics from the event can be found <a href="http://buraglio.com/pics/ncsa/JointTechs-Madison2006/">here</a>. They were all taken with my treo so they&rsquo;re not the greatest. I had Blatz on tap and even brought home a 12 pack of it. I also had some of the best fish I&rsquo;ve had in a while, overall it was a good trip.</p>
