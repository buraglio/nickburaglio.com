I&rsquo;ve been watching a lot of <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/">Doctor Who</a> lately. I always enjoyed it as a kid (the <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0048982/">Tom Baker</a> Doctor). I think it was my grandpa and his love of british humor that introduced me to &ldquo;The Doctor&rdquo;.<br />
&hellip;So, on a whim, I went out and got <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0436992/">the new (9th and 10th Doctor) Doctor Who seasons (2005-2006)</a> and watched them. WOW. The storied were always great, funny and interesting, yet serious and entertaining at the same time. The sets left a little to be desired. Apparently in the old days there was only around $18 to make the sets and effects. What a pleasant surprise to see that the new seasons has all the same draw as the old but now also had some pretty nice effects. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Sci-Fi, you need to watch these. They&rsquo;ve even spawned a spin-off show <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0485301/">Torchwood</a> (an anagram for Doctor Who), I began watching that tonight and so far, so good.</p>

<p>Synopsis:<br />
<em>Captain Jack Harkness, the former Time Agent and con man from the 51st century last seen traveling with the Doctor, ventures to early 21st century Cardiff. There, he becomes a member of Torchwood Institute, a renegade criminal investigation group founded by Queen Victoria to battle hostile extraterrestrial and supernatural threats.</em></p>
