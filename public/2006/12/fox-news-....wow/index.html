			<p>It&rsquo;s a widely accepted opinion that Fox news seems to be a little biased. I really don&rsquo;t watch the news so I had only others speculation to draw upon. Then I saw this. It certainly gives a compelling argument in favor of that opinion. Thankfully, I get most of my news from the net.</p>

<p>And WOW&hellip;..</p>
