			<p>One of the things that is somewhat lame about the employer paid verizon plan I have is the lack of the ability to dial #MIN (#646) to get an estimate of the minutes you&rsquo;ve used. For some reason that feature is purposely disabled on the account. I found a nice free little app that works really well for this. It&rsquo;s very configurable and once the tweaking has been completed (at least on my phone) it&rsquo;s pretty accurate.<br />
It does take some configuration. You can do things like beam your minute statistics or export them to memo pad which is very handy for archiving them.</p>

<p>The directory assistant app is also very handy. Both work on the Treo 600 and Treo 650 and are both _free_!</p>
