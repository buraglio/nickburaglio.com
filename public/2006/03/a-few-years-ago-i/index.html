			<p>A few years ago I got into brazilian jiu jitsu and submission wrestling. It&rsquo;s been somewhat of an obsession since then, taking any free time I can find to train or cross-train for it. As I&rsquo;m getting a little older and 15 years of hard skateboarding have taken it&rsquo;s toll on my poor knees and back, I try to train as hard as I can now for fear that I won&rsquo;t be able to later. Well, for about 2 and a half years I&rsquo;ve been talking about getting mats or a mat for my house so I can train here too. Expense and space were a factor until the last year, as of then it&rsquo;s just been indecisiveness. Well, thanks to a friend of mine who will remain nameless, I have a <a href="http://buraglio.com/pics/bjj/basement-dojo/newmat.jpg">big ol&rsquo; mat</a> now. It&rsquo;s roughly 12&rsquo;x20&rsquo; and takes up a decent amount of my basement. Some guys that routinely beat up on me helped me get it down there and it&rsquo;s probably not coming out in one piece. Actually, it&rsquo;s quite handy for stretching as well, I use it every morning before I work out to stretch on and it&rsquo;s nice and soft. I certainly am a lucky person =)</p>
