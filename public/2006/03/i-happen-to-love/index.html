I happen to LOVE <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0083929">fast times at rigemont high</a>. We had been talking abou t this at work, and I got to laughing at my favorite parts, namely the Jeff Spicoli scene with the bagel. It&rsquo;s a well known fact that I love 80&rsquo;s movies. Although Fast Times was a little before my time I did grow up watching a lot of movies in the genre on HBO or Beta and even more at the beloved <a href="http://cinematreasures.org/theater/11552/">Clintonia Theater</a>.<br />

<p>Since I know there has to be at least a few others that appreciate the humor that I do I thought I&rsquo;d post a link to some good <a href="http://alanb.com/spicoli/">spicoli stuff</a>. The ironic thing is that this page was originally created and hosted at my <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">current workplace</a>.</p>
