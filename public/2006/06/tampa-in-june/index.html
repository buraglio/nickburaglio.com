			<p>I have not been to florida in june in several years. It&rsquo;s certainly as hot as I remember. It&rsquo;s no qonder that the baseball game SCinet took us to was in an enclosed, air conditioned stadium. I never knew that baseball could be like that! Traveling for 2 days, returning just in time to drive to the ms150 in DeKalb, IL. It&rsquo;s (been) a busy week.<br />
