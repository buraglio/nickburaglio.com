			<p>Tonight while walking our dogs Rebecca and I saw the giant Garcias pizza balloon flying really, really, really low around our neighborhood. It came within a few feet of our house and the house across the street. It was kinda surreal to watch so I recorded it and took several pics with my Treo. Video can be found <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/images/garciasballoon1.3g2">here</a> and <a href="http://buraglio.com/nick/images/garciasballoon2.3g2">here</a>.</p>
