<h3 id="sierra-nevada-porter">Sierra Nevada Porter</h3>

<p>I saw this and couldn&rsquo;t resist trying it. I must admit that I didn&rsquo;t know that the Sierra Nevada Brewery made a porter. I was skeptical but went ahead and paid the $7.99 for a six pack. 5.6 percent alc. per 12oz bottle, it had a thin, light head when first poured. A much more bitter porter than I anticipated, I was a little disapointed to be truthful. It had a strong but quick bitter aftertaste and was not nearly as sweet as any of the other porters I wrote about here. I don&rsquo;t know that I&rsquo;d recommend this beer as a &ldquo;must try&rdquo; but I wouldn&rsquo;t go out of my way to get one.</p>
