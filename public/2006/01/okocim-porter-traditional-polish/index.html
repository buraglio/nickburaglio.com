<h3 id="okocim-porter">Okocim porter</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Traditional polish taste&rdquo; it says on the bottle. A dark, thicker, quickly sweet porter. Malty and strong, sharp and quicker flavor than many porters I&rsquo;ve had. 8.3 percent alc. in this one pint bottle that I picked up at Friar Tuck for $2.99. This was a little different in a way I really couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on. I&rsquo;d probably buy this again, but I wouldn&rsquo;t drink more than one.</p>
