o;t figure out how to add different calorie burning activities. I don&rsquo;t use a windows machine so I have not tested the windows app to see if thats needed. Once I figure that out I&rsquo;ll happpily give them my $20. If you&rsquo;re looking for something that tracks calories, fat, cholesterol, excercise / activities etc, I think I can safely recommend <a href="http://www.rmrsoft.com/palm/diet.htm">rmrdiet</a>. I&rsquo;m going to try putting it back on my SD card and see if it crashes&hellip;</p>
