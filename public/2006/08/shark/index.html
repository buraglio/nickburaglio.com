<p>Rebecca and I spent the weekend in downtown chicago to &ldquo;get away&rdquo; for a bit. It really was quite relaxing, even with my aggrivated back. We got the hookup and got into the <a href="http://www.sheddaquarium.org/">Shed Aquarium</a> for free, and circumvented the hour-long line. Quite cool. We enjoyed <a href="http://www.discovery.com/sharkweek">Shark Week</a>, something I&rsquo;ve done for a long time and were looking forward to seeing the sharks there. We certainly weren&rsquo;t disapointed. I forgot the camera but managed to snap some crappy pics with my treo. They can be found <a href="http://www.buraglio.com/pics/vacations/shed-2006">here</a></p>
