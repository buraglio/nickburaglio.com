<p>I went to a SCinet meeting last week in Reno, NV to which I&rsquo;d never been. I&rsquo;ve also never been to Las Vegas, but Rebecca told me basically waht it was like, something that isn&rsquo;t really my style. I don&rsquo;t smoke and I don&rsquo;t gamble, both of which are abundant in Reno. The hotel/casino we stayed in and had our meetings in reminded me of the movie Casino, everyone looking out of style and place. Most were almost Zombie-ish. I did manage to gamble a grand total of $2 in the 3 days I was there; I don&rsquo;t see the draw. Since supercomputing will be there in 2007 we figured we should find at least *something* to do. We happpened across a _nice_ brewpub. By nice I mean that they had a fairly comprehensive selection of beers that they make there. I managed to sample almost alll of the varieties, including the porter, stout, IPA and several of the what beers. All were very good, highly recommended in fact. The name of the place is the <a href="http://www.greatbasinbrewingco.com/">Great Basin Brewing Company</a>, and so far it&rsquo;s the best thing I&rsquo;ve seen in Reno. They also had a fried dill pickly, which we managed to try. It was &hellip;&hellip;interesting. Not too bad actually. I&rsquo;d eat one again.</p>

<p>We had to fly back the day after the brits foiled the terrorist thing on the 10th, it made for an interesting day at the airports. All the time on the plane aggrivated my back again&hellip;..fun.</p>
