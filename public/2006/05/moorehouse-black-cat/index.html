A very tasty english black ale, the Moorehouse Black Cat is a dark malty ale. Full flavored with a little hoppy after taste. It is surprisingly refreshing, not overly filling, not overly hoppy. I don&rsquo;t know the alcohol content, it&rsquo;s not terribly strong, i&rsquo;d estimate mayby a 6 or 7%. I picked this up at the local friar tuck for $3.99. I&rsquo;d recommend this for anyone that likes dark brews.</p>
