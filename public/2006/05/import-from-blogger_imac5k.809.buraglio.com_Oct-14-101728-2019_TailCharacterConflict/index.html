			<p>Well, as you can see if you actually read this thing, I got the entire blog imported from blogger. It really was a pretty easy task. There is a lot of documentation on doing it.<br />
I started with <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/movabletype/docs/3.2/g_contextsensitive_help/entry_import/start_title_html.html">this</a> but it wasn&rsquo;t as helpful as I&rsquo;d hoped. I then googled for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=import+blogger+Movable+Type&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official">this</a> and found pretty much everything I could have imagined regarding the process. Anyone looking to do the same should check out <a href="http://weblogs.about.com/od/weblogsoftwareandhosts/a/bloggertoMT.htm">this article</a>. It tell you stem by step pretty much everything you need to do.<br />
Everything is now in a nice sql database for easy backups and I have control over the whole process. It&rsquo;s also nice that I can publish <a href="http://nickburaglio.com/images">images</a> directly from my treo.</p>
