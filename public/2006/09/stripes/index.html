			<p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083131/">Stripes</a> is a great movie. I bought the extended edition a while ago. While I believe Stripes is a &ldquo;must own movie&rdquo;, I was sorely dissapointed in the deleted scenes. For some reason I was thinking about Sgt. Hulka today, one quote in particular:<br />
Soldier, I&rsquo;ve noticed you&rsquo;re always last&rdquo; Winger replies with &ldquo;I&rsquo;m pacing myself Sargeant&rdquo;. Genius.</p>
