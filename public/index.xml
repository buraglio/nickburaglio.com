      <description>This section of buraglio.com is maintained by the domain owner, me, Nick Buraglio.
I&amp;#8217;ve owned buraglio.com (as well as .net, .org and many other domains) since around 1997 and have done my best to do at least something with it.
My technical notes and postings (other than maybe some stuff about gadgets) can be found over at forwardingplane.net, my technical blog.
  I&amp;#8217;m a person of many interests. I hold a bachelors degree in arts and technology (sequence in photography) with a minor in film studies and some of a minor in applied computer science from Illinois State University and am currently employed by the University of Illinois as a Lead Network Engineer and am the Lead Network Engineer for the National Association of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors (NATOA) broadband project of the year, UC2B.</description>
