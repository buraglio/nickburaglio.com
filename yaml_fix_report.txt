==================================
Date: 2025-12-15

ISSUE IDENTIFIED

Hugo build was failing on Netlify due to malformed YAML frontmatter.
File: content/post/2006-01-16-ive-never-been-an-early.md
Error: Apostrophes inside single-quoted title fields broke YAML parsing

  title: 'I've never been an early'  ❌ (apostrophe breaks single quotes)

FIX APPLIED

Changed all title fields with apostrophes from single quotes to double quotes:
  title: "I've never been an early"  ✅ (double quotes handle apostrophes)

RESULTS
-------
Files scanned: 368
Files fixed: 47
Remaining issues: 0

VERIFICATION
------------
✓ No remaining YAML quote issues detected
✓ All apostrophes in titles now properly escaped
