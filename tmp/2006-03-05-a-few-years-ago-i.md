A few years ago I got into brazilian jiu jitsu and submission wrestling. It&#8217;s been somewhat of an obsession since then, taking any free time I can find to train or cross-train for it. As I&#8217;m getting a little older and 15 years of hard skateboarding have taken it&#8217;s toll on my poor knees and back, I try to train as hard as I can now for fear that I won&#8217;t be able to later. Well, for about 2 and a half years I&#8217;ve been talking about getting mats or a mat for my house so I can train here too. Expense and space were a factor until the last year, as of then it&#8217;s just been indecisiveness. Well, thanks to a friend of mine who will remain nameless, I have a [big ol&#8217; mat][1] now. It&#8217;s roughly 12&#8217;x20&#8242; and takes up a decent amount of my basement. Some guys that routinely beat up on me helped me get it down there and it&#8217;s probably not coming out in one piece. Actually, it&#8217;s quite handy for stretching as well, I use it every morning before I work out to stretch on and it&#8217;s nice and soft. I certainly am a lucky person =)
