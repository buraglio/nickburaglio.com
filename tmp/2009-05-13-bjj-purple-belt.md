This week I received a Purple belt in [Brazilian Jiu Jitsu][1] under [Jack McVicker][2]. Having trained in bjj since about 2002 under [Jack][2], it was a very great honor to receive this promotion. Training with the high level guys that I work with several times a week certainly helps progression of skill and technique, of course having great instruction doesn&#8217;t hurt either.

In this image are (left to right) Rob Andres, [Jack McVicker][2], Peter Roubal, Me ([Nick Buraglio][3])

So, since bjj.org is pretty much gone and their &#8220;Instructor Lineages&#8221; page has gone with it, here is the progression of my rank:  
[Helio Gracie][4] => [Rickson Gracie][5] => [Wellington &#8220;MegaTon&#8221; Dias][6] => [Jack McVicker][2] => [Me][3] (Purple Belt).
