One of the things that is somewhat lame about the employer paid verizon plan I have is the lack of the ability to dial #MIN (#646) to get an estimate of the minutes you&#8217;ve used. For some reason that feature is purposely disabled on the account. I found a nice free little app that works really well for this. It&#8217;s very configurable and once the tweaking has been completed (at least on my phone) it&#8217;s pretty accurate.  
It does take some configuration. You can do things like beam your minute statistics or export them to memo pad which is very handy for archiving them.

The directory assistant app is also very handy. Both work on the Treo 600 and Treo 650 and are both \_free\_!
