This van is amazing. I always wanted a &#8220;real&#8221; van, like an A-Team or Scooby Doo van, but was never really able to make it happen. As of last week, though, we&#8217;re the owners of a 2011 Toyota Sienna. This 2011 Toyota Sienna is just downright amazing. It drives like a car but has the volume of a full sized van.
