I am and always have been a huge Star Wars fan. I am old enough to remember ESB and lucky enough to have seen ROTJ in the theater. However, I, like many die hard fans, was completely turned off by EP 1, 2 and 3. So much so that I have erased them from my memory and consider them to never have existed. That is why I wasn&#8217;t terribly excited when I heard that there was a [new one being released][1] (and being directed by [J.J. Abrams][2]).<img class="aligncenter wp-image-691 size-full" src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/jar-jar-binks.jpg" alt="jar-jar-binks" width="353" height="450" />

&nbsp;

And then I saw the trailer.

Wow. Fantastic. I was excited again. I _want_ to see this one. Now, that&#8217;s not why I&#8217;ve made this post. The reason for this post is because not only is there **A NEW STAR WARS MOVIE COMING OUT**, it appears to _not_ suck. And there are a TON of great parodies of the trailer. Hysterical trailers. I&#8217;ve compiled a few of them here.

Official Trailer:

Guardians of the Galaxy trailer; you knew this would come and it is worth the watch:

Lego version; also pretty funny:

&#8220;George Lucas special Edition&#8221; parody; had to be done, he deserves it for making me wait in line for a day to have my experienced ruined by [Jar-Jar Binks][3]:

Even a [spaceballs][4] version:

Enjoy, Star Wars Fans, it looks like Boba Fett may have dragged this franchise out of the saarlacc pit.
