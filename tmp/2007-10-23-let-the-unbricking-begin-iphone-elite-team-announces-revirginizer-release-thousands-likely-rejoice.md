Over at Google Code, the iphone-elite team has released their revirginizing tool, which is designed to rebuild your iPhone&#8217;s seczone lock table. After using this tool, the team suggests, your 1.0.2 unlocked iPhone will return to its pre-unlocked state and be safe to upgrade to 1.1.1. I&#8217;m sure that this is a VERY welcome release for those that unlocked their delicious little iPhones with an early release of iUnock or anySIM, which basically prevented an upgrade (or bricked an unlocked phone) to Firmware 1.1.1 because of certain things that were changed/rewritten on the baseband radio.
