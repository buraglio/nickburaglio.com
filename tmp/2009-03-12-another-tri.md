Several people have mentioned triathlons to me in the last 2 weeks, which has me thinking&#8230;..could my injury riddled body, damaged from years of skateboarding, distance running, boxing and submission wrestling handle another triathlon?   
I have not participated in one since 2006, and really not trained properly for one since 2005&#8230;..I have also not run any event runs or races since 2007 (or run at all since 2007 due to my very beat-to-hell back). Could I participate, perhaps not quite as competitively, in something like a sprint tri?   
I should be able to train very little and still have no issues with something like a sprint&#8230;.at least in my mind. The last event run I ran I did without training at all and finished respectably. 

My limitations are annoying me lately. No more boxing. No more running. No more skateboarding.   
Maybe I lived too hard, was too hard on my back and knees&#8230;.who knows. I guess maybe I used up all of my &#8220;activity capital&#8221; when I was younger.   
I did get the ol skateboard out the other morning and kicked around, just to prove that I could still at least do a few tricks cold. It was also a decent excuse for messing with iMovie 09. Here are the results:

My back didn&#8217;t hurt _too_ bad when I was done. I may try and do the local sprint tri this year. It&#8217;s short enough and easy enough that I can probably do it with minimal prep and and it may just satisfy my need to prove to myself that I&#8217;m not totally falling apart.
