A major TV network hit me with a nastygram telling me that my T-Shirt that I had made, and never sold or even bought for myself, was infringing on their copyright and trademark of a certain high school character played by [Mark-Paul Gosselaar][1] that carried a giant phone. I dare not even mutter the name, which was in the title of the shirt, for fear that the media giant come and take away my will to live. 

<div>
  OK, I was probably naive in using the name. I profusely apologized and left the unsold product off the market.

<div>
  The kicker, however, was that they claimed that the image, that was a picture of me (who looks NOTHING like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark-Paul_Gosselaar">Mark-Paul Gosselaar</a>), was &#8220;evocative&#8221; of their copyright and trademark.

  Wow, that is a stretch. A big stretch. Here is the text that I received:

<div>
  <i>&#8220;We own the rights to the character &#8220;[name I dare not mention out loud]&#8221; and the design is still nonetheless <span>evocative</span> of our copyright and trademark. You have been put on notice. Thank you for your prompt compliance.&#8221; </i>

  For reference, here is the image, wholy created and owned by me (and also a picture OF me).
