I&#8217;m a bit of a coffee nut. I love good, high quality coffee. I&#8217;ve written about it <a title="Greatest coffee mug I’ve ever owned. (16oz Contigo Autoseal Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler)" href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2013/12/27/greatest-coffee-mug-ive-ever-owned-16oz-contigo-autoseal-stainless-steel-vacuum-insulated-tumbler/" target="_blank">many</a>, <a title="Coffee Facts" href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2009/01/02/coffee-facts/" target="_blank">many</a>, <a title="coffee counteracts alcohol effects on liver?" href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2006/06/12/coffee-counteracts-alcohol-effects-on-liver/" target="_blank">many</a>, <a title="Caffe Ladro" href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/2011/09/05/caffe-ladro/" target="_blank">many</a> times.   In fact, I have a hard time getting going before coffee in the mornings, having been a coffee drinker since I was ~17 (I have no clue how my teeth aren&#8217;t stained; it baffles the dentist).  I don&#8217;t drink soda, just coffee, water and beer.  So, when <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/163685099/hey-joe-coffee-mug-brew-joe-on-the-go" target="_blank">a kickstarter for the Hey Joe brewing coffee mug </a>was brought to my attention, I thought &#8220;wow, why has no one done this before?&#8221;.  What is it, you ask? It&#8217;s a battery powered, heating, coffee brewing mug.  That&#8217;s right.

<img class="alignright  wp-image-660" alt="b4d953c3acb64df68c5d551c8088024e_large" src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/b4d953c3acb64df68c5d551c8088024e_large.jpg" width="392" height="262" />

My initial reaction to this was &#8220;ok, I need that.  Now&#8221;.

Anyone that travels and appreciates good coffee could really benefit from this mug.  I like an afternoon coffee, and when I&#8217;m traveling I have to find a decent place to get it and that is generally not an easy task because I like _good_ coffee, and not over heated, burned coffee served too hot.  I&#8217;ll often end up with what I call &#8220;gas station swill&#8221; which is a poor substitute for decent coffee.  I partake in coffee when I&#8217;m traveling especially, and hotel coffee is&#8230;less than stellar.

Starbucks is&#8230;.consistent.  And over-roasted.  And served too hot.  And too expensive.  I will always seek out a decent mom-and-pop shop but those are hit and miss.

I could see myself traveling with this thing.  Lets hope it meets the kickstarter request, because, frankly, I want one.  Check out the video if you don&#8217;t believe me.

<span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Cool, right?  </span><a style="line-height: 1.5em;" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/hey-joe-coffee-mug-2014-6" target="_blank">Business Insider even thinks so.</a><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">  I hope it gets funded, it really is a neat idea (and I want one, damnit!).  I can name the number of things I&#8217;ve donated to on kickstarter on one hand.  This is one of them.  </span>
