<span>Outside of networking (and even within networking to a certain extent), the buzzword of the day is &#8220;The cloud&#8221;.  All of your data will be in &#8220;the cloud&#8221;.  Think </span>[<span>Skynet</span>][1]<span>.  </span>[<span>Cloud computing</span>][2] <span>is how much of our data is handled today.  </span>  
<span>What is that, you ask?  </span>  
<span>&#8220;</span><span><b><span>Cloud computing</span></b></span><span><span> is </span></span><span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Internet" title="Internet"><span>Internet</span></a></span><span><span>-based </span></span><span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Computing" title="Computing"><span>computing</span></a></span><span><span>, whereby shared resources, software, and information are provided to </span></span><span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Computer" title="Computer"><span>computers</span></a></span><span><span>and other devices on demand, like the </span></span><span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/wiki/Electricity_grid" title="Electricity grid"><span>electricity grid</span></a></span><span><span>.&#8221;  &#8211;According to wikipedia.  </span></span>  
<span><span>Why is this even remotely interesting?  Well, as of now, much of what I do has been moved into &#8220;the cloud&#8221;. My contacts are stored within google&#8217;s massive cloud, as are my emails, calendar, and now this blog text.  </span></span>  
<span><span>I have an Android based phone now, even the config that my phone is built from is in the cloud.  I&#8217;ve moved my photos into </span><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/buraglio"><span>flickr</span></a><span>.  My mail is a Google Apps domain.  Why would I do such a thing, you ask?  Because it&#8217;s REALLY freakin&#8217; convenient.  I don&#8217;t have to run a server anymore.  I don&#8217;t need to keep up spamassassin signatures or maintain any postgres or mysql databases.  </span></span>  
<span><span>Its also scary.  All of my data is not under my control anymore.  Once it hits the internet, it&#8217;s never possible to know for sure it&#8217;s gone should I want it removed.  This is a frightening thing when one considers the privacy ramifications.  I&#8217;ve been slowly moving to this model over the last 5 or 6 years.  I was an early beta tester for the google apps and moved my mail around 2005.  Other data has been slowly migrating since then.  </span></span>

<span>Security is not convenient, and convenient is not often secure.  Lets hope our cloud overlords take pity on us when they take over the world.  </span>
