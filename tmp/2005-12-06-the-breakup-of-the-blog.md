The breakup of the blog really didn&#8217;t work. I have been so busy with work that I didn&#8217;t post at all. I had been traveling a lot lately, Seattle, Mexico, back to Seattle. All in all I was gone about a month. Seattle is probably the coolest US city I&#8217;ve been to, not as rain-soaked as many say. Both times I was there (a 4 day trip and an 11 day trip) for work it drizzled a bit but for the most part it was pretty nice. I would love to go again, it seems like the Pacific Northwest is somewhere I could stay for a while. Supercomputing was great as always, awesome food, cool projects, fun times. We did have time to hit the REI store, several of us climbed the pinnacle (which I had never done before).

I did the [NCSA][2] booth this year as well as worked with [SCinet][3] on various things. I had the best seafood that I&#8217;ve ever had in my life, if you are a fan of seafood I HIGHLY recommend taking a trip to the Washington coast area. [Some pics from the trip.][4]

Something else announced,  [Force10 networks][5]has acquired a pretty cool little company; [Meta Networks][6]. For those that don&#8217;t know, Meta Networks makes a very cool IDS card that can do 10gig with minimal overhead to the host OS. At [SC|05][7] they announced the purchase and gave a little talk regarding the product. Livio Ricciulli, the founder of Meta Networks was there to help with the product, which was used by [SCinet][3] to help secure the very high performance network. VERY cool stuff indeed. I like the idea of the programmable card (that can do a LOT of cool stuff) a little more than the way that [Endace][8] cards operate, although the endace 10gig cards are very nice as well.
