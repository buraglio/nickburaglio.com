Man, watching the [Lakai Fully Flared][1] video atmy friend Sean&#8217;s suggeston makes me really miss skating every day. At 33 It&#8217;s a little hard on my body after all the abuse but I did get the board out and do a few kickflips and curb tricks for the neighbor kids today. It was worth it but, unfortunately, it made my body really feel the years of abuse. I may kick around at the C-U park a little tomorrow&#8230;&#8230;  
Hopefully I&#8217;ll still be able to walk afterwards&#8230;&#8230;..

I think Jeff Byrd owes me $5 for still skating after I hit 18 Years old.

Watch this and feel in awe&#8230;..
