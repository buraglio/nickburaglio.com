I spent some time making my Oktoberfest (yeah, I know I&#8217;m like months late) and decided it might be fun to try and film it to show others that it&#8217;s actually pretty easy and economical to make a 5 gallon batch of home brewed beer. Well, after about an hour and a half of editing and a realization that my camera work for this one really kinda stunk, I was done and had a 30 minute &#8220;documentary&#8221;. It&#8217;s not the greatest and I have found a few places that I don&#8217;t like the editing, but it&#8217;s already uploaded to Google video (it was too big for YouTube). It&#8217;s about 30 minutes long, so if you wanna watch it, be aware of that:

&#8211;Edit 4/17/2011, Google video had removed their content so this has been broken up and moved to youtube.
