I just read on a message board that I sometimes look at about a movie coming out based on the 2001 book [American Hardcore][1] by [Steven Blush][2]. It looks pretty good as far as documentaries go, although there was talk of how the book was somewhat incorrect. Of course, it is based on one guy&#8217;s experience as far as I know. I ordered the book today so I&#8217;ll hopefully get that read before the film is out, if not I&#8217;ll probably have to wait to see it. These are probably some of my favorite bands and types of music, although I came in after most of it was over in the late 80&#8217;s, partially due to the fact that I was born in 1975 and partially because I lived in a small midwestern town of about 7000 people with no real ties to anywhere that anything groundbreaking was happening. More info can be found [here.][3]   
Trailer for the movie via youtube.com:
