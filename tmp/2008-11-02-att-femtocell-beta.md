![femtocell][1]

According to [engadget mobile][2], AT&T may be following suit and begin testing [Femtocells][3]. This is great news for anyone in a marginal coverage area that is able to get terrestrial broadband.  
I, for one, would love to test one (especially if it meant I could finally have 3g).  
More info can be found [here][4].
