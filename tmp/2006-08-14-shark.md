Rebecca and I spent the weekend in downtown chicago to &#8220;get away&#8221; for a bit. It really was quite relaxing, even with my aggrivated back. We got the hookup and got into the  [Shed Aquarium][2] for free, and circumvented the hour-long line. Quite cool. We enjoyed  [Shark Week][3], something I&#8217;ve done for a long time and were looking forward to seeing the sharks there. We certainly weren&#8217;t disapointed. I forgot the camera but managed to snap some crappy pics with my treo. They can be found [here][4]
