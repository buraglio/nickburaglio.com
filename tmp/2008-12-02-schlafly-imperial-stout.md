It&#8217;s been quite a while since I did a beer review and I&#8217;ve had SO many unique brews since the last one, but the most recent beverage I had worth writing about was the [Schlafly Imperial Stout][1]. I was able to enjoy this the other night thanks to my brother-in-law Rob. I would highly recommend this big brew to anyone that has $ to drop in one big, dark, powerful beer. It&#8217;s got some good undertones of bourbon with a little bite, but overall pretty silky.   
I like the Schlafly brewery and, since I&#8217;m only about 2 and a half hours from St. Louis, I like to try their stuff and support a [kinda] local brewery. 

Overall I&#8217;d probably give it an A-/B+. I&#8217;m not a huge imperial stout fan (and I&#8217;m certainly too cheap to buy a bottle myself unless I&#8217;d had a few beers first) but overall I really liked this brew.
