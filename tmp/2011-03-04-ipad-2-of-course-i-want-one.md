I got a 64Gig Ipad for xmas. I love it. I use it all of the time for work, at the gym (for watching video on the bike) at home and on the road.   
It&#8217;s a great device, even though I was underwhelmed when it forst came out. After using it a bit I realized that it&#8217;s like a hybrid between my iPhone and my MacBook. A more convenient device for quick but more detailed work or entertainment.

Now, merely 2 months after I got mine, there is a new one. I knew that would happen, thats the way tech stuff always works, especially apple. Do I want the new one, of course. I&#8217;m like a kid when it comes to gadgets. Will I get the one one? Not likely. I&#8217;s more likely that I&#8217;ll wait until iPad 3. 

I found [this Conan O&#8217;Brien skit][1] pretty entertaining given my &#8220;iPad circumstance&#8221;
