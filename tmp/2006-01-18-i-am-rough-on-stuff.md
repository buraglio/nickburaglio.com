I am rough on stuff. I needed a good case for my Treo 650. I had many a choice in this area but was patricularly interested in the rubber &#8220;skin&#8221; type cases. I have wanted one of these for my ipod but never got around to getting one. I did a little readong and decided on the [Spec Products][1] [Skintight][2] case. I liked the fact that it had a sscreen cover that I could remomve if needed and came with a holster for when I was feeling particularly geeky and wanted to wear it on my pocket (which is rare). It was a little pricey at [$34.99 from Treonauts][3] but work was paying so I went for it. My initial impressions were good, I opted for the Black case to &#8220;hide&#8221; dirt. The installation was simple, quick and painless. It covers and protects nicely. I&#8217;m a pretty pickey person when it comes to something I use every day (otherwise I generally don&#8217;t care) so I&#8217;ll point out some of the things I \_didn&#8217;t\_ think about.

1. I like to keep stuff in my pockets, the case has a friction to it that pretty much disallows this when I&#8217;m wearing jeans. No big deal I can just clip the case to my pocket or belt.

2. The way the clip works is not conducive to using an SD card. The clip pushes out my SD card every time I put the treo in it. Very annoying to say the least.

3. I can&#8217;t get to the SD card easily if I want to change it. This really doesnt occur often, but it&#8217;s still something I didn;t think about.

4. I can&#8217;t beam stuff from the Treo because the IR port, like the SD card port is protected by the case.

5. I can&#8217;t easily do a soft reset without removing it from the case.

Again, I think this is a really good case, I think it is a very nice compromise of form and function, these are just things that I didn&#8217;t think about (or didn&#8217;t research enough before making my purchase). I would recommend this case to those that, like me, are rough on their gadgets. I have been extremely pleased with how well this has protected my Treo650 in the 3 weeks that I&#8217;ve had it so far.

The plus sides are many:

Cutout for camera. (I don&#8217;t really use the camera much but it&#8217;s available if needed)  
Easy to use, removeable flip up screen cover  
Cutout for mute toggle, stylus, dock / power and side buttons  
Can take a beating  
does not cover keyboard, making for easy use.  
not overly expensive

For those that are even more rough on their gadgets than me, there is a [Ruggedized version][4] available for the same price.  
I&#8217;d like to try out the [Smartphone Experts S650 Skin Case][5] as soon as I can get around to buying it. If someone wants to donate it thats be great too, I&#8217;d be happy to write a &#8220;regular guy&#8221; review of it.
