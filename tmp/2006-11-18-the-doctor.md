I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of [Doctor Who][2] lately. I always enjoyed it as a kid (the [Tom Baker][3] Doctor). I think it was my grandpa and his love of british humor that introduced me to &#8220;The Doctor&#8221;.  
&#8230;So, on a whim, I went out and got [the new (9th and 10th Doctor) Doctor Who seasons (2005-2006)][4] and watched them. WOW. The storied were always great, funny and interesting, yet serious and entertaining at the same time. The sets left a little to be desired. Apparently in the old days there was only around $18 to make the sets and effects. What a pleasant surprise to see that the new seasons has all the same draw as the old but now also had some pretty nice effects. If you&#8217;re a fan of Sci-Fi, you need to watch these. They&#8217;ve even spawned a spin-off show [Torchwood][5] (an anagram for Doctor Who), I began watching that tonight and so far, so good.

Synopsis:  
_Captain Jack Harkness, the former Time Agent and con man from the 51st century last seen traveling with the Doctor, ventures to early 21st century Cardiff. There, he becomes a member of Torchwood Institute, a renegade criminal investigation group founded by Queen Victoria to battle hostile extraterrestrial and supernatural threats._
