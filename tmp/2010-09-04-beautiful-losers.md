I had been wanting to see the film &#8220;[Beautiful Losers][1]&#8221; since I&#8217;d heard of it, and I finally had the opportunity to sit down and really enjoy it.  This is certainly a movie worth your time if you are interested in real artists, living and working like real artists in todays world.   
I originally wanted to see this because of the heavy influence from the skateboarding world (a world I spent a very good deal of my youth in) but also because I had always aspired to be an artist (and even went and got a degree in arts and technology).  I have a great deal of respect for folks like [Mark Gonzalez][2] and especially [Ed Templeton][3], for their great artwork and their fierce adherence to being creative and living life on their own terms.

Rent this, it&#8217;s worth your time.
