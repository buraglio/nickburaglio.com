Always being on the lookout for good, well put together information, I came across [this network oriented technical blog][1], and it was a pretty helpful find, containing many of the ACLs and details for HSRP, BGP, OSPF, VRRP, GLBP. I posted a comment containing VRRP-E information.   
Anyone that has to deal with these protocols will likely find this a decent reference, and since they&#8217;re all things that network engineers use all the time, it&#8217;s nice to have them all in one place.   
I would suggest adding his [RSS Feed][2] to whatever your favorite RSS reader is. There is a lot of good information there and (unlike myself) the author seems pretty diligent about keeping it updated with _useful_ information.
