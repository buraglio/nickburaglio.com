[Some stuff as leaked][1] about the pricing of the iPhone from apple to be launched by Cingular/AT&T in the next few months. Surprisingly (to me at least) the prices were $200 lower than was expected. I&#8217;m still ion the fence about switching to Cingular and gettin an iPhone. I like the idea of Rollover, and I love the idea of having a SIM in my phone. On the other hand, I have been relatively happy with Verizon for a few years and I don&#8217;t think I can give up the calendar or functions my Treo offers.  
We all should have such problems&#8230;..

This image is a link, I don&#8217;t want to post the original since people have been called to pull it.
