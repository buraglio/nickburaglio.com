This Movie / Documentary looks very cool. IT should be playing at [Boardman&#8217;s][1] soon. This guy is crazy, but it kinda makes sense. 

It&#8217;s getting great reviews:

_&#8220;I am afraid of heights. Now you know. That is one reason I was helplessly engrossed in &#8220;Man on Wire,&#8221; the story of how Philippe Petit crossed eight times on a tight-wire between the two towers of the World Trade Center on Aug. 7, 1974. Another reason is that the documentary, a hybrid of actual and restaged footage, is constructed like a first-rate thriller.&#8221;- Roger Ebert \* \* \* \*_

_&#8220;James Marsh&#8217;s brilliant documentary on a Frenchman&#8217;s 1974 high-wire walk between the twin towers has the pace of a thriller and the human interest of a psychological drama.&#8221;- LA Times_
