Straight off of the [pfw][1] mailing list: <http://www.allard.nu/pfw/blocklists/>  
I had written some bad perl code that did something similar, importing and munging the data in the PeerGuardian list and installing in in a pf table, so far this looks much better. I&#8217;m anxious to check this out and am hoping to make it work easily with [pfsense][2].
