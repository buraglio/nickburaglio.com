I don&#8217;t know about you, but I found this incredibly frightening&#8230;  
[<img src="http://www.thegfloor.co.uk/otherstuff/cashmachinewindows.jpg" border="0" alt="" />][1]

With all the talk of the [CTA machines being vulnerable][2] and [other MTA][3] machines crashing or being problematic I got to thinking about how many mission critical or sensitive systems are vulnerable, rooted, 0wn3d or whatever. Most Cash machines used to be OS/2 but that&#8217;s been changing lately and I know for sure some are moving to windows. Lets just hope all these systems are well maintained or more secured than they probably are&#8230;..probably wishful thikning..

I&#8217;m a paranois by nature. I&#8217;m untrusting. I don&#8217;t like people very much because most of them are stupid (myself included at times). You know, the more I think about it, it&#8217;s not really the systems that are most at risk. Social engineering is much easier than r00ting a box and most targets are underpaid, unhappy workers that just don&#8217;t care. How many bank tellers do you know that are well paid? How many personal assistants to powerful execs have access to their email and desktop machines? If you think it&#8217;s difficult to talk that info out of one of them you are sorely mistaken. Wow, I made myself even more paranoid by that thought alone&#8230;.Social engineering is often overlooked and ALWAYS a threat.
