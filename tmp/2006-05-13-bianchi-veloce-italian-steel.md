Well, I finally got the new road bike that I had been selling all my stuff off to get. It was a long process, dealing with Bianchi sending the wrong bike, Bikeworks getting enough time to assemble it, getting it home, getting clipless shoes (expensive!!) etc, etc. But it&#8217;s finally here and I must say, it&#8217;s FAST. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I love my [Trek 7300FX][2], I ride it to work whenever weather and work permits, but this is a road bike, and it&#8217;s quite a different experience. It&#8217;s almost like comparing apples to oranges, they&#8217;re both fruit but too different to compare. I have had it a week as of today and the weather has been crummy since the day after I got it so I&#8217;ve only been on two short rides, but WOW! The clipless pedals make a HUGE difference. The carbon fork and slick [campagnolo][3] components don&#8217;t hurt either. I can&#8217;t wait to take this puppy on a 30+ mile run. I was hoping to ride from Champaign to Clinton tomorrow but the weather doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;ll permit. Maybe next weekend.
