[Stripes][1] is a great movie. I bought the extended edition a while ago. While I believe Stripes is a &#8220;must own movie&#8221;, I was sorely dissapointed in the deleted scenes. For some reason I was thinking about Sgt. Hulka today, one quote in particular:  
Soldier, I&#8217;ve noticed you&#8217;re always last&#8221; Winger replies with &#8220;I&#8217;m pacing myself Sargeant&#8221;. Genius.
