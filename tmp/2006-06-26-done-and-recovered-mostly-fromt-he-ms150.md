Some of Team Remarkable:

Well, the MS150 is done. Day 2 started pretty crummy. Rain, cold and general lack of enthusiasm on the general rider population was obvious. I was trying to be pretty upbeat, but it&#8217;s my belief that many riders (with the exception of team remarkable) just didn&#8217;t go out. We started a little late, around 0730 or so, about 15 minutes in the rain cleared and it dried up, but it stayed overcast mahing for a really nice ride. We opted for the 75 miles on day 2 as well, there wasn&#8217;t much wind at all and the 75 mile route had sparsly placed riders. Many that ride opted for the 35 mile route. Rebecca did the 35 mile route as well and I think she sprinted through it because she was done in a really quick time. When we stopped in Rollo, I decided that I would partake in the &#8220;famous&#8221; burgers with a fried egg on top. <img alt="eggburger.jpg" src="http://www.buraglio.com/nick/images/eggburger.jpg" width="640" height="480" />WOW! I don&#8217;t eat a lot of red meat but that burger with an egg was GREAT. I took a pic of it. The ride laster a little longer since we all had ridden the day before. One mile before the finish, SAG came by and told us that because of lightning that had been sighted (dark clouds had rolled in) that we had to be SAG&#8217;d in. My cousing Jeff tolf the guy that we only had 1 mile left and we were going to ride it. He said &#8220;I can&#8217;t force you&#8221; so we all rode right around him and into the finish as it started to rain. It was a great experience and I plan to raise money and ride as long as I am able.  
Special thanks to all who donated!

Next year I&#8217;m planning on doing the century (100 miles) on day 1 and none on day two. If my fund raising goals are met, I&#8217;ll be riding with a RED mohawk. Stay tuned!
