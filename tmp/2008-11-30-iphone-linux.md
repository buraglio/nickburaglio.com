[That iPhone Dev team][1] has decided to port the linux kernel and [BusyBox][2]to the iPhone and write a completely new boot loader to support dual booting. 

[iPhone Linux Demonstration Video][3] from [planetbeing][4] on [Vimeo][5].

I&#8217;m not sure that it really means anything for everyday users of the iPhone at this point, but it&#8217;s certainly interesting for geeks, hobbyists, code hackers and possibly developers.   
If I had a spare iPhone I might give it a whirl just to see it work, but since I don&#8217;t I&#8217;ll just be satisfied with the announcement.   
Any way you look at it&#8217;s pretty nifty.
