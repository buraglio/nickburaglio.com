I&#8217;m extremely irritated by the one last blog that I host on wordpress that I just can&#8217;t seem to get converted to <span>any<span></span></span> other format.   
WordPress, while a very nice publishing platform, isn&#8217;t quite compliant with the XML standard in the way that they format their export files. So, what that means for anyone that has a decent sized blog that they want to move to anything other than wordpress, is that they may be out of luck. Google has a pretty robust set of [blog conversion tools][1], which worked for me for all of my sites, personal and business&#8230;&#8230;except for one. As stated [here][2], wordpress2blogger gives me &#8220;not valid XML&#8221; error when trying to convert. I&#8217;ve cleaned this file as best I can by hand, but it&#8217;s enormous and I&#8217;m still missing pieces. It&#8217;s irritating and at this point I&#8217;m almost ready to keep this one as a one-off and install mysql, wordpress, etc., etc., etc&#8230;&#8230;.

Thanks wordpress.
