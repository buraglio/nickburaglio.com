Anyone that knows me knows that I love T-Shirts. They&#8217;ve been pretty much the only thing I have worn for the bulk of my life, much to my mother and wife&#8217;s dismay. That said, there are a lot of shirt ideas that I&#8217;ve had in the past but I&#8217;ve never had any mechanism for making them. Often it&#8217;s not economical for local print shops to make just 1 or 2 shirts from a design, so a consumer needs to order them in bulk, making it not economical for the consumer. Enter the internet. There are **_so_** many ways to get this done now, from [Custom Ink.com][1], to [Zazzle][2] and [Cafe Press][3] to [Spreadshirt][4] there are a myriad of ways to get a shirt made.   
I opted to put most of my stuff on [Spreadshirt][5] so that anyone can buy a shirt that I thought was cool enough to make. I&#8217;ve added a link to the [&#8220;shop&#8221;][6] at the top of the page for anyone that wants to look.   
This brings me to my newest shirt, the &#8220;[Mac][7] from [It&#8217;s always Sunny in Philadelphia][8] [RIOT shirt][9]&#8220;.   
I didn&#8217;t find an &#8220;official&#8221; one so I decided to make one. It also has a small barcode of &#8220;RIOT&#8221; on the bottom of the back of the shirt, just for an added touch. There were a few others out there but I preferfed a different font (even if it wasn&#8217;t exact).
