I&#8217;ve long been a fan of [Found Item Clothing][1], they have some really obscure shirts that aren&#8217;t found elsewhere and are pretty diligent about reproducing them as closely to the original as possible. I have several of their shirts and have always been very happy with both the quality and the service.   
In keeping with their tradition of finding cool ideas from (often underrated) 80&#8217;s movies, they&#8217;ve introduced the [&#8220;Death Before Disco&#8221;][2] sweatshirt from [Stripes][3]. [Stripes][3] is one of my favorite movies from my youth (along with most other [Bill Murray][4] comedies). 

![Death Before Disco!][5]

I will very likely be ordering this or requesting it for xmas.
