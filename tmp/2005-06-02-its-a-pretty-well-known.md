It&#8217;s a pretty well known fact that I like Apple computers and most people have seen a lot of the spam and ads referring to getting a free mac mini or a free ipod. I always thought they were BS. A scam attempt to harvest email addresses or another version of something nasty.  
Well, interestingly enough, I actually know someone who really DID get the free Mac Mini, I saw it. He already had one, and sold the one he got for free for ~$500 and bought an ipod photo. I was flabbergasted. I couldn&#8217;t believe that it actually worked. There had to be a catch, and in fact, there was.  
I decided that I was going to read up on it, after all, there are tons of people selling this info on ebay, posting it on web forums, etc. Maybe I&#8217;d a actually give it a try. What the hell, right? After doing a little reading it looked to me like it was some kind of a pyramid scheme. I signed up at  [FreeMiniMacs.com][1] with a  [GMail][2] account I use for stuff like this and had at it.  
You have to complete an &#8220;offers&#8221; meaning that you have to sign up for something. THEN, you need to refer (I believe) 10 people to do the same. For what it&#8217;s worth, my link is [here][3].  
We&#8217;ll see how long this takes&#8230;..if it ever completes.
