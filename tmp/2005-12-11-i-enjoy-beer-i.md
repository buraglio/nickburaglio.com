I enjoy beer. I don&#8217;t drink as much of it as I used to, but on occasion I like to down a few good ones (I&#8217;ll also down a few bad ones if that is all there is). I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m a &#8220;Beer Snob&#8221; as I&#8217;ve been known to drink anything from PBR, Natural Lite and Stag to a $12 imported porter. I&#8217;m not normally a big fan of the lighter stuff but I came across this ale, Smithwick&#8217;s. It&#8217;s just the right blend if what I like. A little bite but smooth at the end. From [Realbeer.com][2]:  
&#8220;Made by Guinness in Ireland, Smithwick&#8217;s is inspired by John Smithwick&#8217;s original recipe, which was first brewed at St. Francis Abbey in Kilkenny, Ireland. St. Francis Abbey has been in operation since 1710, making it one of Ireland&#8217;s oldest breweries.&#8221;  
I&#8217;d recommend trying this if you can find it (which has been my problem as of late). It&#8217;s smooth enough that a casual light beer drinker would probably enjoy it but flavorful enough that even a beer snob probably wouldn&#8217;t snicker. I&#8217;d really like to find some more of it, I had a 6 pack given to me and I just finished off the last one. I&#8217;ve tried looking online as well as every local place in Champaign-Urbana, Bloomington and other surrounding Central Illinois towns with no success. I hear tale that it&#8217;s found primarily in larger cities, St. Louis, Chicago, etc., but last time I looked in STL it I couldn&#8217;t find it there either (granted I didn&#8217;t look that hard). If anyone knows somewhere in Central IL (or online) that I can order this please let me know. I&#8217;d love to get my hands on some more.
