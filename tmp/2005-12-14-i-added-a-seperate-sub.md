I added a seperate sub category (that I hope to recruit some people to work on with me); beer reviews. I&#8217;ve always wanted to do beer write-ups but have never really been a &#8220;beer expert&#8221; or a &#8220;beer snob&#8221; so I thought that I probably shouldn&#8217;t do it. Then I got to thinking, maybe thats why I \*should\* do it. I always hated reading pretentious beer drinkers account of some beer they had after playing a polo match or before getting into their limo to be whisked away to their private jet and flown to switzerland to count their money. I like beer. Sometimes I get good beer, sometimes not. Either way I hope to write about it in this [Beer review][1]. Maybe some people will add to it.
