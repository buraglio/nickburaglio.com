  * So far really digging this att nexus one I&#8217;m testing. Android is pretty nice. [#][1] 


  * Really really digging this nexus one a lot. If only I had $500-ish dollars of my own money to drop on one to keep. [#][2] 


  * @[ancker010][3] ive seen arista stuff at sc09 and its good for top rack but limited for most other stuff. [in reply to ancker010][4] [#][5] 


  * @[sn0weater][6] worst ticketing system. Ever. [in reply to sn0weater][7] [#][8] 


  * Android 2.1 now on this HTC magic thanks to @cyanogen. this phone now actually usable [#][9] 


  * I continue to be impressed with #[android][10]. Upgrade process simple. [#][11] 


  * Very hackable but not quite as refined as iPhone OS. Lots of promise, I&#8217;m probably going to buy my own device ASAP. [#][12] 


  * @[Vap0rz][13] probably not since I don&#8217;t have verizon. Ill probably get a nexus one and wait on the new iphone [in reply to Vap0rz][14] [#][15] 


  * @[cyanogen][16] my magic battery is about what I expect for how much I use it. Working great so far. Thx 4 the release! [in reply to cyanogen][17] [#][18] 


  * @[HoosierCAB][19] belated congrats [in reply to HoosierCAB][20] [#][21] 


  * I can&#8217;t believe all of the things I can do with android that I can&#8217;t do on the iPhone. UI tweaks aplenty. I&#8217;m a huge fan of customizing. [#][22] 


  * @[joshmeans][23] nice. I&#8217;m currently on an old HTC device but I hope to get a nexus one for att. [in reply to joshmeans][24] [#][25]
