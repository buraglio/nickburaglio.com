  * blah, I think my lawn mower is dead. [#][1] 


  * The HTC incredible is a really sweet device. I wish There was a gsm version available with AT&T 3g. [#][2] 


  * tor running on my #[pfSense][3] box. Pretty trivial to make work from CLI. Maybe I should make this a package&#8230;&#8230;..in all of my spare time. [#][4] 


  * @[Vap0rz][5] incredible is more elegant. Droid more of a workhorse. I like &#8217;em both but can&#8217;t have either. [in reply to Vap0rz][6] [#][7] 


  * gw kernel: pid 11127 (tor), uid 256, was killed: out of swap space. Soekris setup just isn&#8217;t powerful enough for tor, I&#8217;m guessing. [#][8] 


  * Digging the #[twitter][9] #[android][10] app [#][11] 


  * Just burned up a 48Gig SSD and an 8G flash drive thanks to @[modrzeje][12] leaving the wrong power supplies bundled with USB hub. Thanks dude. [#][13] 


  * @[modrzeje][12] #[fail][14]. You owe me coffee. [in reply to modrzeje][15] [#][16] 


  * See, we&#8217;re putting new cover sheets on our TPS reports. [#][17] 


  * Thanks @AAirwaves, 3,000 bonus miles from #[americanairline][18]s for my 3 hours of delays last week. [#][19] 


  * @[modrzeje][12] nice [in reply to modrzeje][20] [#][21] 


  * @[jlgaddis][22] I have one. Shoot me a pm and ill send it over. We are a huge consumerof their gear [in reply to jlgaddis][23] [#][24] 


  * #pfSense 2.0 ipv6 tunnel scripted and working again. Needs GUI but I&#8217;m tired. [#][25] 


  * @[devivo][26] Not the bore worms! [in reply to devivo][27] [#][28] 


  * Farmers market sounds like fun for this morning. [#][29] 


  * Upgraded to @[cyanogen][30] 5.0.7 DS-test7 on the HTC Magic. Upgraded seamlessly, seems quite a bit snappier now. Thanks for the hard work! [#][31]
