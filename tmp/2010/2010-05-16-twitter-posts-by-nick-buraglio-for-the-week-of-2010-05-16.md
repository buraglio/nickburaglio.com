  * Yawn. Hotel coffee really sucks when you&#8217;re used to @[weeklyroast][1] [#][2] 


  * Really impressed with the Arkansas University and ARE-ON folks at this @[internet2][3] #[IPv6][4] workshop. Great job guys, well done! [#][5] 


  * Really, really enjoyed being an instructor for the @[internet2][3] #[IPv6][4] class down here in beautiful Fayetteville, Arkansas. #[fb][6] [#][7] 


  * @[cvkline][8] A-MAZ-ING. Went 2 nights in a row, possibly best beers I&#8217;ve experienced at a brewpub, ever. Great food as well. Seriously good. [in reply to cvkline][9] [#][10] 


  * @[cvkline][8] Very good Imp IPA, belgian trip, coffee porter&#8230;.the list goes on. Very diverse offering and all were not good, but \*great\*. [in reply to cvkline][9] [#][11] 


  * @[cvkline][8] and the brewmaster is only like 29 years old. Very impressive. <a href="http://www.hoghaus.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hoghaus.com/</a> [in reply to cvkline][9] [#][12] 


  * Homeward bound. [#][13] 


  * Imagine that. Delays at o&#8217;hare airport. Very inconvient. [#][14] 


  * With all of the storms down here I wish I would have brought a HAM radio to listen to the chatter. Many tornados in AR. [#][15] 


  * Finally departing XNA for IND via ORD (odd path, I know). [#][16] 


  * Yay for landing in Chicago. Hopefully I&#8217;ll have a connecting flight. iPhone battery at 2% üôÅ [#][17] 


  * I leave for 4 days and my neighbor constructs a fence, connects it to mine w/o asking and likely without measuring property lines [#][18] 


  * @[tsrimovsky][19] Both. Seriously, who does that without at least asking? Very uncool. I&#8217;m going to request it be removed for real. [in reply to tsrimovsky][20] [#][21] 


  * @[RadishSpirit][22] coffee, then pizza, then coffee again. [in reply to RadishSpirit][23] [#][24] 


  * @[RadishSpirit][22] well done. I am still working on coffee part deux. [in reply to RadishSpirit][25] [#][26] 


  * @[liquidrider148][27] I need to make one as well. Thinking about a @[weeklyroast][1] subscription. [in reply to liquidrider148][28] [#][29] 


  * @[Vap0rz][30] it can be done for \*much\* cheaper than that. [in reply to Vap0rz][31] [#][32] 


  * @[Vap0rz][30] you can get it done elsewhere for much cheaper but rolex will always cost more. [in reply to Vap0rz][33] [#][34] 


  * @[Vap0rz][30] what the heck happened to it? It should be sapphire and nearly indestructible [in reply to Vap0rz][33] [#][35]
