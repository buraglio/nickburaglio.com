  * AT&T 3g data sucking hard in #[chambana][1] area lately. #[att][2] [#][3] 


  * @[ATTJason][4] I think it&#8217;s a known issue in this area. Regardless, it&#8217;s not convenient. [in reply to ATTJason][5] [#][6] 


  * Wifes iPhone in the dog water, check. Garage fridge compressor not working, check. Today is going to be expensive. [#][7] 


  * My blackberry pearl from 2007 is \*awful\* compared to my not-even-recent iPhone 3g that the wife now has. [#][8] 


  * Basic apps installed on old bberry [#][9] 


  * Moving back to this interface from the iphone isn&#8217;t gonna be easy or fun. Its not intuitive at all. [#][10] 


  * @[sn0weater][11] wifes went in the dog water so she got mine and I am on my old bbery from 2007 [in reply to sn0weater][12] [#][13] 


  * @[RadishSpirit][14] @[sn0weater][11] wifes went in the dog water so she got mine and I am on my old bbery from 2007 [in reply to RadishSpirit][15] [#][16] 


  * Going to give @[uBreakiFix][17] a try for the wife&#8217;s dog water damaged iPhone. $99 is much cheaper than a new one. [#][18] 


  * @[prezmcmahon][19] wife&#8217;s went in the dog water so she got mine and I am on my old blackberry from 2007. It&#8217;s pretty harsh after ~3 yrs w/iPhone [in reply to prezmcmahon][20] [#][21]
