  * @[jlivingood][1] I absolutely would test IPv6. I&#8217;ve been using it 4 years via a tunnel at home and natively at work. It needs to be everywhere [in reply to jlivingood][2] [#][3] 


  * @[jlivingoodand][4] re: IPv6, I could name 10 other highly technical ppl throughout the US that would actually use it and give \*useful\* feedback. [#][5] 


  * Taxes are boring. [#][6] 


  * @[Jokerjitsu][7] I think you can get that in Indiana too&#8230;.that pesky midwest region. [in reply to Jokerjitsu][8] [#][9] 


  * @[jlivingood][1] I&#8217;m ready. I&#8217;m tired of tunneling v6 to get to work stuff. I sent you mail re: v6 transit via comcast site as well. [in reply to jlivingood][10] [#][11] 


  * Dark horse blueberry stout and chocate ice cream was not on my diet/workout plan&#8230;.still totally worth it. [#][12] 


  * Heading back from replacing an optic in our adva gear in chi. Had some lunch with @[jdugan][13] [#][14] 


  * Holy CRAP!! @[comcast][15] is offering an IPv6 beta service! <a href="http://www.comcast6.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.comcast6.net</a> #[win][16] SIGN ME UP! [#][17] 


  * @[corbinsiddall][18] Seriously. I feel like it&#8217;s 2003 all over again (re: IPv6). Hopefully I&#8217;ll get on the trial early so I can drop my old tunnel [in reply to corbinsiddall][19] [#][20] 


  * @[jlivingood][1] already done!! Thanks!! [in reply to jlivingood][21] [#][22] 


  * I HAVE to watch smokey and the bandit whenever it&#8217;s on. It reminds me of being a kid. It&#8217;s also a great movie. East bound and down, baby. [#][23] 


  * @[FlipTheBit][24] oddly enough, I actually do. Very uncommon for me to have any American lager in the house but very apropriate in this case. [in reply to FlipTheBit][25] [#][26] 


  * @[queritor][27] join the club. [in reply to queritor][28] [#][29] 


  * My switcheasy capsule rebel iPhone case has pretty much fallen apart after almost 2 years of use. I&#8217;ll be sans case from now on I guess. [#][30] 


  * Ive had a case on an iPhone so long I forgot how thin and elegant they really are. I may leave this iPhone &#8220;naked&#8221; and hope I don&#8217;t break it [#][31] 


  * @[ancker010][32] so far I&#8217;m one day safe. I had my original iPhone naked forever and it was fine. We&#8217;ll see. [in reply to ancker010][33] [#][34] 


  * Good coffee and Bill and Ted on tv. Bill and Ted reminds me of high school. [#][35] 


  * @[RadishSpirit][36] you know it. [in reply to RadishSpirit][37] [#][38] 


  * AT&T-friendly Nexus One passes through the FCC  
    <a href="http://is.gd/7mglz" rel="nofollow">http://is.gd/7mglz</a> [#][39] 


  * I think it may be time for me to look at QEMU again. [#][40] 


  * Another todo list item is to get the rest of the parts for 10gal homebrew boil and all grain. Between my cousin and I we are 90% there. [#][41] 


  * @[RadishSpirit][36] I&#8217;ll be working on that project sooner than I think too. [in reply to RadishSpirit][42] [#][43] 


  * Late lunch at Milo&#8217;s in Urbana&#8230;.always amazing. [#][44] 


  * I&#8217;m not sure if I dig this new mirrored screen protector I put on my iPhone. [#][45] 


  * @[Vap0rz][46] agreed. [in reply to Vap0rz][47] [#][48] 


  * RT @VonWelch: Abode Air fails to update itself again. Hard to recall something as unreliable. &#8211;windows? [#][49] 


  * Mac OS X 10.3 installed on Nokia N900 via PearPC, barely usable for impatient geeks
