I spent some time up in Alaska recently (Fairbanks, to be exact) and I have to say, it was pretty intersting. I taught the ipv6 workshop and participated in a few other talks at [Joint Techs, Summer 2011][1]. I didn&#8217;t have a ton of time to spend all around the last frontier, but I did get to do a bit of light hiking and exploring on my last day there (before Delta Airlines botched my return flights).   
I think other than the conference (which was really good), the highlights were certainly the food. I had an Elk burger at [The Pump House][2], ate myself stupid at the [Alaska Salmon Bake][3], had a few really good brews and a delicious bison burger at [Silver Gulch Brewery][4], and hung out until the sun went down (wait, it never sets in Fairbanks in July) at [The Marlin][5]. ([Yelp][6]). All were totally worth while. While Fairbanks was a little smaller of a college town, it&#8217;s a big city in Alaska. If I ever make it back there I&#8217;d really like to hit up the [Chena hot springs][7]. If I had it to do over again, I would have taken my nice DSLR camera and made another trip to Silver Gulch (the northernmost brewery in the United States). Oh, I also saw the northernmost Denny&#8217;s, which was proudly displayed on a sign. 

I grabbed a few pictures with my iPhone and my point and shoot available [here][8] or in this slide show.
