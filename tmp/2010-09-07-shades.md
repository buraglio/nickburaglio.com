I recently replaced my aging (and now scratched) Ray Ban sunglasses (RB 4009) with a pair of New Ray Ban Predator [Ray Ban RB4026][1]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=nickburaglioc-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=B001UQ71N2" width="1" />  
series. The old ones had served me well (purchased in 2004; a replacement of my early 1990&#8217;s pair of the same style) but they&#8217;d recently been dropped and the lenses scratched pretty severely. So, how did I usher in the new pair? By dropping them like 4 hours after I bought them. Luckily no scratched lenses on the new pair so far&#8230;
