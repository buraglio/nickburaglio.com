My back is feeling better and I&#8217;ve resumes training for my sprint triathlon. I have not yet really started back at boxing, jiu jitsu or wrestling but hopefully this thursday I&#8217;ll be rolling with some friends from home. Speaking of home, the [Clinton Daily Journal][2] ran a story on us doing the ms150 bike tour. It didn&#8217;t have the whole story online so I made a quick scan (above).
