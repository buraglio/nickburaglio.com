I saw this over at my [brother&#8217;s blog][1], and it looks pretty amazing. I&#8217;m a really big fan of zombie and post-apocalyptic stuff and this appears to have high potential. I&#8217;ve not read the [graphic novels][2] (although I will be obtaining it and reading it before the premiere), but if Mike says it&#8217;s good, it probably is.  
AMC has been pumping out some really good stuff, lets hope this lives up to the trailer.
