### Okocim porter 

&#8220;Traditional polish taste&#8221; it says on the bottle. A dark, thicker, quickly sweet porter. Malty and strong, sharp and quicker flavor than many porters I&#8217;ve had. 8.3 percent alc. in this one pint bottle that I picked up at Friar Tuck for $2.99. This was a little different in a way I really couldn&#8217;t put my finger on. I&#8217;d probably buy this again, but I wouldn&#8217;t drink more than one.
