Well, I am officially a &#8220;nerd&#8221; according to most of my friends. I set a goal for myself to get my HAM radio license, for a few reasons. The first being that I am goinf to be in Tampa, FL at the tail end of hurricane season adn want a way to contact people not via net or phone if need be. The second being that I have a severe lack of electronics knowledge and thought this would be a good way to get introduced. I sat for the Tech ticket last Sunday and passed it and was issued [KC9JVU][1] as my callsign as of yesterday. I applied for a vanity callsign today so we&#8217;ll see how long that takes. I have been playing with  [echomac][2] and the [IRLP][3] stuff, it&#8217;s pretty slick; right up my alley with the VoIP stuff. Now I can legally have a scanner in my car, too. Now to re-learn morse code&#8230;&#8230;
