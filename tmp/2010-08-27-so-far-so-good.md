I&#8217;m liking the move back to blogger so far. I do miss some of the flexibility that wordpress gave me, but overall I&#8217;m willing to trade that for not running a database server anymore.  Blogger is available over [IPv6][1] using the [google over any v6][2] resolvers, which is very cool, and the VPS I moved to at [ARP networks][3] to host DNS and basic HTTP is also fully v6 native.   
I&#8217;m also really, really liking the move to [flickr][4] for my photo hosting.  I paid for a pro account and have been very pleased with the integration and wealth of tools and apps.   
I have to say, though, that the entire reason that this move was spawned (other than the fact that I&#8217;ve been thinking about it for a while) is that I installed an app called [PicPush][5] on my Android Nexus One .   
This app allows me to automatically publish all images taken with my android device with 0 user intervention (and allows for a timer to to so; I have mine set to 15 minutes).   
[Here][6] you can find all of the images in my &#8220;Mobile&#8221; flickr set.  There are things in there from as far back as my Treo 600, but most of the stuff is relatively new and always updating as I snap images.
