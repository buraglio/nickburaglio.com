I went to [Joint Techs][1] in Madison, Wi this week. Overall it was pretty good, I learned a lot of stuff and experienced a lot of the dynamics of some major networking initiatives. Madison is a great city, I&#8217;d never been there and Rebecca had been saying it was really funa nd beautiful. She was right. Pics from the event can be found [here][2]. They were all taken with my treo so they&#8217;re not the greatest. I had Blatz on tap and even brought home a 12 pack of it. I also had some of the best fish I&#8217;ve had in a while, overall it was a good trip.
