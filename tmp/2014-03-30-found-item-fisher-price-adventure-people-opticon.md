  I&#8217;m a sucker for my old toys. I never throw anything away and I still have a huge amount of my toys from the late 70&#8217;s through the 80&#8217;s. That is what makes this find so interesting.  I had a few of these &#8220;<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Fisher+Price+Adventure+People&oq=Fisher+Price+Adventure+People&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i60l2.493j0j7&sourceid=chrome&espv=210&es_sm=119&ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">Adventure People</a>&#8221; manufactured by Fisher Price, and I played with them <strong>a lot, </strong>but I had all but forgotten about them until I pulled this one, the &#8220;opticon&#8221;, out of a box my oldest son and I were looking through.  I had no memory of this whatsoever because it was so obscure, until I saw it.  Memories came rushing back, I clearly remembered getting it in Bloomington, IL at what I believe was Montgomery Wards.  There is surprisingly little on these toys on the &#8216;net, but they are readily available on ebay and there are <a href="http://mosseisley.blogspot.com/2013/09/more-fisher-price-adventure-people.html" target="_blank">collectors out there still able to find carded figures</a>(!!)  The Opticon was pretty cool because of the large crystal in its back and the fact that it folded over into what I always called a &#8220;sleep&#8221; mode.  <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_4040.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-653 aligncenter" alt="IMG_4040" src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/IMG_4040-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a>

  This find drove me to spend far too much time researching these toys, which triggered a few more memories.  I realized that I had possessed a few more toys from this series.  Most notably, I had the space alpha interceptor and the pilot and the opticon (shown above).  I played with that interceptor quite a bit.  It had a really cool design that came apart into a smaller ship or spun around in the middle of the larger chassis and the guy, even though he didn&#8217;t move much, was very neat with his enclosed head and weird eye goggles.  <a href="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/interceptor.jpg"><img class="wp-image-650 alignleft" alt="interceptor" src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/interceptor-1024x768.jpg" width="491" height="369" /></a>My belief is that the interceptor is in a box in my parents basement but the guy is probably long gone.  I&#8217;ll blame my brothers for that (sorry Mike and Chris, blame rolls down hill).  I plan to dig around next time I&#8217;m down in 61727 and see if I can find it.  until then, I&#8217;ve handed over the Opticon to my boys to add to the arsenal of other vintage stuff for hours of adventure.
