A constant figure in our lives for the last 15+ years, Chloe was our faithful companion.  I recall taking her to work with me in my early days in

Chloe was our faithful co-pilot on many adventures, outliving nearly all of her &#8220;vet school buddies&#8221; and all but one of our original seven pets. [<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-448" alt="IMG_0500" src="http://www.nickburaglio.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/IMG_0500-300x200.jpg" width="300" height="200" />][2]

Chloe came from the vermilion county  pound as an adult, likely a year or so old when Rebecca found her in 1997 as a junior surgery dog at the UIUC Vet school. She went from being a timid, quiet dog to the alpha female of the house in a very short time.  Being obviously part corgi, she would often herd cats, other dogs, kids, whatever needed put in line.  There is almost no story I can think of over the the last ~16 years that don&#8217;t involve or are related in some way to Chloe.

There is a very distinct absence in our home without her that will, just like with [Lenny][3], likely never be filled.  She will be missed greatly.
